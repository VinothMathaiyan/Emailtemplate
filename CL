I hope you are doing well.

I’m reaching out regarding the OneCert feed file management process. As you know, we were previously granted an exception to submit the user feed file manually on a weekly basis due to the automation setup not being in place yet. This exception was approved for an initial period of two months and we truly appreciate your support during that time.

Now that the exception period has concluded, we understand from our recent discussion that there won’t be any further extensions permitted by default. However, we are currently facing some challenges in implementing the automation within the expected timeline. Due to technical dependencies and coordination with the Qualtrics engineering team, we are unable to complete the setup as quickly as anticipated.

Given these circumstances, we would like to inquire if there’s any formal way to request a short extension of the exception period—ideally for another 2 to 3 months—so that we can continue the manual weekly submission while working toward the automation.

I remember you had mentioned earlier that we either:

Submit the feed file manually on a daily basis via the incident portal, or

Raise an error if that is not feasible.

Before proceeding with either of these options, we wanted to check if there is an escalation path or a senior contact who we can reach out to for requesting an extended exception, considering the situation.

We would really appreciate your guidance on whether such an exception extension can be considered again, and if so, the right process or person we should contact for this request.

Thanks again for all your continued support.
