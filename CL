Automation Workflows
1. File Reception
We receive files twice daily from the Workday team at X AM and Y PM.

Workflow 1 is scheduled to run twice a day, X + ab hours and Y + cd hours, to process these files.

2. Data Loading
The processed files are loaded into the ABCDlist every day.

3. Sampling File Preparation
The 2nd workflow prepares the sampling file.

This workflow runs based on a predetermined timeline, either every 65 days or 90 days.

4. IMH Level 2 Workflows
Separate workflows are required for each value in IMH Level 2.

Qualtrics Support (ABS) needs to create 5 distinct workflows for these values.

Testing Process
1. File Extraction
The testing process is still in progress as the file extraction setup needs to be completed.

We are waiting for AB to extract the necessary files.

2. File Naming Convention
The Workday team needs to establish a consistent file naming convention to prevent any overwriting of files.
