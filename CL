am reaching out to escalate the ongoing issue with mapping personal email IDs for Instant Leavers in the Leaver Survey process.

Problem:
Since July 2024, we have been unable to send surveys to Instant Leavers because the personal email mapping is not in place. This issue has caused the survey distribution to be on hold for the past six months.

Reason for Delay:
During testing and hypercare, we were informed that personal email mapping was still in progress and would take time to complete. However, we have now been told that the mapping is still not in place.

What We Need:

Confirmation: Will the personal email mapping be implemented?
Timeline: If yes, when can we expect it to be ready?
Next Steps: If itâ€™s not planned, what change request (CR) or process adjustment is needed to ensure Instant Leavers can be contacted like regular leavers?
This delay has already impacted our ability to distribute surveys to Instant Leavers, and we need clarity to update stakeholders and move forward.

We would appreciate your response and guidance on next steps. Please let us know if a discussion is needed.
