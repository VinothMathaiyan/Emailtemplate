 Score each item 1–5 based on availability (Available=5, Partial=3, Not available=1), weight by importance (e.g., High:Medium:Low ratio 3:2:1 normalized), then take the weighted average to get a 1–5 score for the “Survey build” category. This approach aligns with standard RFP weighted scoring and rubric anchors for “fully/partially/does not meet.”

Mapping and weights
Availability to score: Available → 5; Partial → 3; Not available → 1, reflecting “fully meets,” “partially meets,” and “does not meet” rubric anchors on a 1–5 scale.

Importance to weight: Use a 3:2:1 ratio for High:Medium:Low, then normalize across the 7 features so weights sum to 1; this preserves relative importance per weighted-scoring best practice.

Worked example table
Scenario: 7 features under “Survey build”: 3 High (A, N, P), 2 Medium (A, P), 2 Low (A, A). “A=Available,” “P=Partial,” “N=Not available.”

Feature	Importance	Availability	Individual score (1–5)	Weight	Weighted score
H1	High 	A 	5 	0.20 	1.00 
H2	High 	N 	1 	0.20 	0.20 
H3	High 	P 	3 	0.20 	0.60 
M1	Medium 	A 	5 	0.1333 	0.6667 
M2	Medium 	P 	3 	0.1333 	0.4000 
L1	Low 	A 	5 	0.0667 	0.3333 
L2	Low 	A 	5 	0.0667 	0.3333 
Combined Survey build (1–5) 	3.53 
Notes
The 1–5 anchors (“does not meet” to “fully meets/exceeds”) follow common RFP rubrics; using 5/3/1 for availability keeps scoring consistent and auditable.

The 3:2:1 importance ratio is a simple, transparent way to reflect High/Medium/Low; any ratio is acceptable if normalized and documented in the scorecard
