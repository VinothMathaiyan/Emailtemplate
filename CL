Subject: Process Steps for OneCert Feed File Management (Post-Exception Period)

Hi [Team/Name],

Iâ€™m writing to outline the current process steps we are following for the OneCert feed file management, particularly after the exception period granted by the tech team has ended.

Background:
Our user access management requests are handled through the request portal maintained by the tech team. To ensure accuracy and alignment with leaver and mover processes, the tech team requires daily updates of user details. While the long-term plan is to automate this via integration between the HR tech portal and Qualtrics, this integration is not yet in place. As a result, the feed file is currently being managed manually.

Previously, an exception allowed us to share the feed file weekly, as the application had only recently gone live in the request portal. This exception was valid until the end of April. Now that we are in May, we are expected to submit the file on a daily basis.

Current Manual Process:
Until the integration is completed, the following manual process is being followed daily:

Prepare the User Feed File:

The file includes only privileged users (excluding default users).

It is formatted with the required headers as specified by the tech team.

Convert Data to Required Format:

The row values are structured as per the format expected for the feed processing.

Submit Feed File:

The completed file is submitted daily via the incident management portal.

Tech Team Action:

The tech team picks up the feed file.

They run validations against current active user data to detect any leaver or inactive accounts.

If discrepancies are found (e.g. disabled accounts), the tech team informs us to remove access from our systems accordingly.

Next Steps:
We understand that to move away from manual handling, integration needs to be set up. For that:

We will coordinate with the Qualtrics engineering team to enable automation.

The user feed will be routed to a designated SFTP path.

The tech team can then directly pick the file from there for their checks.
