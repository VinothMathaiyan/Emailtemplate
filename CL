Subject: Next Steps for Survey Tool Assessment and Transition Process

Dear [Senior Leaders, Tech Team, Viva Team],

I hope you are all doing well. I wanted to provide a status update on the business requirements gathering for our survey tool assessment and the upcoming transition to a new tool, with a particular focus on the Viva Suite for the GLINT program.

As you know, we have successfully gathered business requirements from various stakeholders involved in the colleague listening programs. This includes feedback from HR and non-HR teams who are currently using Qualtrics for various surveys and programs. The next step in the process is to move forward with liaising with the Viva team, who is our next potential partner for the GLINT program, and the tech team, who will review the gathered business requirements.

Here’s an outline of the steps we are expecting as we move forward:

Gap Analysis: The tech team will review the business requirements we’ve gathered and conduct a gap analysis. This will help us understand where the current solutions might not align with our needs or where additional features may be required.

Review by Architecture Team: Once the gap analysis is completed by the tech team, it will be submitted to the architecture team for review. This will ensure the solution is scalable, secure, and aligned with the organization’s overall IT infrastructure.

Next Steps & Clarifications: We need clarity from the tech team on the following points:

Roles and Responsibilities: Who will be responsible for each part of the transition process? What are the key roles within the tech team, Viva team, and architecture team?

Decision Authority: Which individuals or teams will have decision-making authority throughout this process?

Milestones and Timelines: What are the key milestones we should expect? What is the timeline for each stage, including when we should expect the tool’s proposed solution to be ready for evaluation?

Evaluation and Validation: How will we ensure that the new tool will meet all the business requirements gathered so far? What metrics or validation criteria will be used to assess the tool’s readiness?

Frequency of Engagement: We’d like to establish a regular cadence of communication throughout this process. Is it preferable to have weekly or bi-weekly meetings to ensure timely discussions and updates?

Target Date for Stakeholder Engagement: Based on the gap analysis, we aim to have a clear plan and timeline to present to our stakeholders. We’d like to finalize a target date for releasing the outcome of the assessment to stakeholders.

We are committed to ensuring that this transition is seamless and aligns with all business requirements while also meeting the technical, security, and scalability needs of our organization.

Please let us know your thoughts on the proposed next steps, and kindly advise on any additional details we should consider to ensure we move forward efficiently. We appreciate your support and collaboration on this important project.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. Looking forward to your feedback.

Subject: Gathering Business Requirements for Future Colleague Listening Tool

Dear [Team/Stakeholder],

I hope this message finds you well. As you may be aware, our organization currently uses Qualtrics to run our colleague listening programs, capturing feedback across various colleague journeys such as engagement, onboarding, learning, and more. This tool has been integral to our efforts in measuring and enhancing the employee experience.

However, as our Qualtrics license will be expiring in 2026, we are exploring potential alternatives to support our business needs going forward. At this stage, it remains uncertain whether we will transition to a new tool or continue with Qualtrics, but we are keen to ensure that any future platform fully supports our diverse requirements.

To better understand the needs of all stakeholders involved in the colleague listening program, we are gathering business requirements in the form of user stories. This includes feedback from both HR and non-HR teams who are directly dependent on Qualtrics in some capacity—whether they are running HR-specific programs such as learning and leaving, or business-driven initiatives like customer satisfaction and audit programs.

As part of this process, we have:

Collected business requirements from all relevant stakeholders, including product owners, HR and non-HR colleagues, and other dependent teams.

Consolidated and removed duplicates from the collected requirements, refining them further for clarity.

Prioritized these requirements, categorizing them into "must-have" features, "good-to-have" features, and optional improvements.

Your insights and feedback are critical as we continue to refine these requirements. We want to ensure that the future tool we adopt will effectively serve the needs of all users involved in colleague listening, with an emphasis on streamlined processes and improved user experience.

We kindly request your continued input on the following:

Are there additional features or capabilities that should be considered for the new tool?

What challenges are you currently facing with Qualtrics, and how could they be addressed in a new platform?

We are in the process of finalizing the requirements and plan to present them for further review and alignment soon.

Thank you for your time and ongoing support. If you have any questions or would like to provide additional insights, please feel free to reach out.
