Data Privacy: Emphasize the importance of sharing collected data securely, using permissions or password protection when necessary.

Exporting and Sharing Data: Show how to export responses to Excel for further analysis or sharing. Advise on best practices for sharing, like using OneDrive with restricted access or secure links.
