Dear [Business Manager's Name],

X from the Proxy team has conducted an in-depth analysis and identified that a specific JavaScript file is causing a significant delay in load time. After implementing changes in the test environment, the load time was notably reduced. However, due to the current change freeze, these improvements cannot be released to production without a strong business justification.

Given that I rely on Qualtrics for my day-to-day operations, this delay directly impacts my deliverables and overall efficiency. The longer load times affect productivity and could potentially impact project timelines.

I am requesting your approval to prioritize and implement this change in production. Addressing this issue promptly will enhance system performance and support seamless operations. Please let me know if you require any additional information to facilitate this decision.

Thank you for your consideration.
