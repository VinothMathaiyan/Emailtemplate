Title: Accessible Date Picker Integration for Surveys

1. Project Overview
Project Name: Accessible Date Picker Integration

Project Description:
This project integrates an accessible date picker component from the Duet Design System to enhance user experience by allowing easy and valid date selection for survey start and end dates. The system automatically calculates and sets a reminder date 3 days after the start date. Validation feedback is provided using default alerts, and the navigation button is enabled only after valid dates are selected.

3. Objectives
Page Load Functionality:

The page will load with the following:
Information explaining the functionality of the date picker component.
The start date will default to today's date.
The end date will default to 4 days after the start date.
Captured Backend Data Fields in Qualtrics:

JS_Survey_Open_Date: Captures the user's selected survey start date. This ensures the survey opens on the specified date using JavaScript.
JS_Survey_Close_Date: Captures the user's selected survey end date, ensuring it is at least 4 days after the start date. This is also managed using JavaScript.
Survey_Reminder_Date_API: Automatically calculates and stores a reminder date 3 days after the start date to trigger user notifications.
Validation Feedback:

Users will receive clear validation messages through default alerts:
"Start date cannot be in the past."
"End date must be at least 4 days after the start date."
Navigation Button Behavior:

The navigation button remains disabled until the user selects valid start and end dates. Once validation criteria are met, the button is enabled, allowing users to proceed.
4. Accessibility: Keyboard Navigation
Duet Date Pickerâ€™s keyboard support closely follows the W3C Date Picker Dialog example, with optimizations for iOS VoiceOver and Android TalkBack.
