Introduction
In our current process, creating and formatting surveys is a manual task involving exporting questionnaires from Word documents or PowerPoint files and then manually copying them into Excel. This process leads to inconsistencies and is highly time-consuming, impacting our productivity. To address this, we need to streamline the process of updating our master questionnaire, reducing manual effort and saving time.
Proposed Solution
Automating Survey Question Extraction:
1.	Extract QSF File:
o	Manually extract the .qsf (Qualtrics Survey Format) file from Qualtrics and store it in a designated folder.
2.	Run Python Scripts:
o	Execute the Python scripts to process the .qsf file.
o	The scripts extract survey questions, including metadata, and format them into an organized Excel file.
3.	Update Master Questionnaire:
o	The Python scripts update the master questionnaire with all the questions extracted from the .qsf file.
o	This automation eliminates the need for manual copying and pasting.
4.	Clean HTML Tags and Links:
o	The scripts automatically clean up any HTML tags or links present in the survey questions.
o	Ensure a clean and readable output in the Excel file.
5.	Format Excel Outputs:
o	Adjust column widths for readability.
o	Apply header coloring to enhance visual appeal.
o	Save time and ensure a professional presentation.
This automated solution streamlines the process of updating the master questionnaire, reducing manual effort, and saving time. By cleaning HTML tags and links, it ensures a clean, organized, and consistent output in the Excel file.
Step-by-Step Process
Step 1: Extract QSF File
•	Begin by manually extracting the .qsf file from Qualtrics.
•	Store the extracted file in a designated "QSF" folder on your system.
•	Rename the file appropriately for easy identification by the team.
Step 2: Run Python Code
•	Execute the Python script designed for processing the .qsf files.
•	Input the file name directly into the script when prompted.
•	The script generates the output and stores it in the "Excel" folder.
•	Key steps in the run Python code include:
o	Formatting the master questionnaire by aligning columns.
o	Adjusting header backgrounds for clarity.
o	Removing HTML tags and unnecessary styles for a cleaner version.
Step 3: Two Versions of QSF Files
•	The two different versions of the .qsf file stem from variations in the EX and CE product experiences, causing discrepancies when reading the file.
•	To address this, two versions of the Python script were created, ensuring compatibility regardless of the file version encountered.
Step 4: Repeat for Each QSF File
•	Perform Steps 1 and 2 for each .qsf file to update the survey data.
Step 5: Create or Update Master Questionnaire
•	Run an additional Python script for creating or updating the master questionnaire.
•	Provide the filenames as a list or array to the script.
•	The script checks if a master questionnaire file already exists:
o	If it exists, the script reads the file and appends new questions from the latest questionnaire.
o	If it doesn’t exist, the script creates a new master questionnaire file.
•	Additional columns for "File Name" and "Date Updated" are created:
o	"File Name": Indicates the source .qsf file for each set of questions.
o	"Date Updated": Records the date when the update occurred.
Step 6: Handle Columns and Responses
•	Columns in the master questionnaire include:
o	First Column: Qualtrics-generated question ID.
o	Second Column: Custom question ID used in the survey.
o	Third Column: Question text.
o	Fourth Column: Question type (e.g., DB, MC), as generated by Qualtrics.
o	Fifth Column: Responses, separated by a new line for clarity.
•	Ensure responses are user-friendly by listing each option on a new line.
Discussion Points
1.	Removing Trash Questions:
o	Current Approach: Utilized Python script to remove unwanted questions from the .qsf file.
o	Future Plan: Internal discussions to establish a process for removing or managing questions before surveys go live. Assign this as a to-do for everyone involved.
2.	Resetting Survey Blocks:
o	Issue: Discrepancies in question order between Survey Question (SQ) and Survey Block.
o	Approach: Reshuffling question texts to match the intended sequence.
o	Next Steps: Explore options to reset blocks and analyze potential impacts before surveys go live. AB is investigating this further.
Excel to QSF Conversion
Introduction: In our endeavor to increase efficiency and reduce manual effort in survey preparation, we’ve explored the conversion of Excel files to QSF format for direct import into Qualtrics. This approach has proven to be effective in streamlining the creation of survey links, allowing us to generate them within a few hours when the Excel file is organized in the required format.
Current Process:
1.	Organize Excel File:
o	Structure the Excel file according to the required format for QSF conversion.
o	Ensure consistency in columns and headers to facilitate smooth conversion.
2.	Run Conversion Script:
o	Execute the Python script to convert the structured Excel file into a QSF format.
o	The script processes the Excel data, aligning it with Qualtrics survey structure.
3.	Import to Qualtrics:
o	Import the generated QSF file into Qualtrics.
o	Review and verify the survey link to ensure accuracy.
Limitations:
•	Current development does not include advanced features like display logic.
•	Accessibility features are not covered in the basic structure.
Future Developments:
•	Explore the inclusion of display logic in the QSF conversion script.
•	Enhance the script to support more advanced accessibility features.
Long-Term Objective
In addition to the developments discussed, we aim to innovate further with an AI-driven survey generation tool. This tool would take inputs such as the business objective or requirement and existing survey questions in an Excel format. By leveraging previous data, data privacy guidance, and OB scientists' documentation, the system would automate the creation of surveys, reducing manual effort and ensuring consistency.
The proposed AI-driven survey generation tool would offer significant benefits, including:
•	Increased Efficiency: Automate the survey creation process, saving time and effort.
•	Improved Accuracy: Ensure consistent and error-free surveys by utilizing existing data and documentation.
•	Enhanced Compliance: Adhere to data privacy guidelines and organizational best practices.
Closing Comments Implementing this automated solution will not only streamline our survey updating process but also enhance the overall quality and consistency of our master questionnaire. By reducing manual effort, we can focus more on analyzing the survey results and making data-driven decisions. The AI-driven survey generation tool represents a significant leap forward in our long-term objectives, promising further efficiency and accuracy in our survey processes.
