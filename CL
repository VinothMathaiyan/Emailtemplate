Title: Enterprise Risk, Cost, and Dependency Assessment for Qualtrics Dashboard Access Management Enhancement

1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the business and technical risks, dependencies, cost considerations, and proposed timeline involved in transitioning Qualtrics dashboard access management from the existing ServiceNow-based workaround to a more structured and sustainable model, potentially through the enterprise Request Portal. This transformation has been prompted by escalations from the ServiceNow and CDO teams, and requires alignment with Enterprise Risk Controls, the Tech Directors, and the CDO stakeholders.

2. Current State Overview

Tool Usage: Qualtrics is being used as the HR enterprise colleague listening platform for 18+ HR products (e.g., Engagement, New Joiner, Exit, Health Check, Mandatory Learning, etc.).

Platforms: Both Qualtrics Employee Experience (EX) and Customer Experience (CX) platforms are in use.

Integrations:

Workday (via FSFTP)

ServiceNow (via event triggers, Qualtrics Manager Access App)

HRDP (via FSFTP)

Access Management Structure:

Tool-level access: Managed through a Request Portal — includes Survey Edit, Dashboard Edit, Participant Import.

Dashboard-level access: Currently managed through ServiceNow-based HR Hub shared queue and open-text fields — error-prone, lacks validation logic, and has no integration with approval workflows.

3. Problem Statement

The current ServiceNow-based dashboard access management workflow is manual, inefficient, and error-prone:

No drop-down list of dashboards

Approvers manually chosen by requester — often incorrect

Incorrect user details and dashboard names frequently submitted

Reporting team manually validates and forwards to colleague listening team

The proposed solution is to migrate dashboard access management to the Request Portal, similar to the tool-level access process.

4. Proposed Change Overview

Introduce a new ITSI number for a new application in the Request Portal

Define fixed dashboard list (18+) in form dropdown

Configure logic to auto-select business approver based on dashboard

Capture access level type (view/download/line-level)

Trigger sequential approval workflow: Line Manager → Business Approver → Provisioning Team

Provision roles via automated or manual OneSearch feed file sent to MFT/SFTP daily

5. Key Risks

#

Risk Area

Description

Impact

Mitigation

R1

Feed File Complexity

OneSearch file needs to be created by combining EX & CX user roles across 18+ dashboards

High

Feasibility to be confirmed with Qualtrics Support

R2

AD Group Unavailability

Automation via AD groups not feasible for EX roles

High

Manual provisioning required unless future AD group mapping is set up

R3

Manual Provisioning Unsustainable

Daily feed file creation requires significant support effort

Critical

Confirm CX export feasibility and automate as much as possible

R4

Timeline Misalignment with ORAC

Only 1-2 month manual provisioning exemption allowed

High

Parallelize ITSI creation, request build, and feed feasibility check

R5

Business Approver Logic

Multiple dashboards with different business units, roles, and approvers

High

Require business ownership alignment per dashboard

R6

Data Privacy

Improper provisioning could lead to data access violations

Critical

Secure approval workflow and restrict feed file exposure

6. Dependencies

Request Portal Team: For form creation, logic setup, workflow configuration

RTB Team: To generate new ITSI number for the dashboard access app

Barclays Provisioning Team: For OneSearch file ingestion and validation

Qualtrics Support: To validate export feasibility from both EX & CX

Colleague Listening / Reporting Team: For OneSearch file design and daily feed generation

MFT/SFTP Team: For secure file movement and monitoring

Line Managers & Business Approvers: Must be clearly defined per dashboard

7. Cost Implications

Development Cost:

Request Portal form build and backend logic

OneSearch feed generation automation (Python/PowerShell scripting)

Support Cost:

Daily feed maintenance if automation not feasible

Troubleshooting incorrect entries / provisioning errors

License/Tooling:

Potential increase in MFT support cost if volume rises

FTE Time:

Business resource for dashboard mapping and approver assignment

9. Open Questions for Review Board (HREXCO, CDO, Tech Leads)

Is there executive sponsorship to maintain ongoing OneSearch feed if AD Group automation isn’t feasible?

Can the CDO/Tech team help coordinate with Qualtrics Support to expedite export feasibility check for EX?

Can a dedicated FTE be assigned to feed file validation until automation is in place?

Should this provisioning be transitioned into a broader Identity Access Management (IAM) initiative?

Are we allowed to enforce fixed approvers for dashboards, or do we need self-selection flexibility?

What’s the maximum period for which ORAC exception can be granted for manual feed files?

10. Recommendations

Proceed with ITSI request and Request Portal form design in parallel

Immediately initiate discussion with Qualtrics Support for EX export feasibility

Design unified OneSearch feed structure with all role mappings

Align with business on fixed approvers per dashboard

Secure executive sign-off for short-term manual effort

Level 1 (System Context – C1)
Goal:
Show the big picture: key systems, personas, and high-level data flows.

Visual:
Draw six boxes:

HR System (People Insights / Minerva / HRDP)

Workday (learning module)

ServiceNow (case/ticket system)

Qualtrics EX (Employee Experience)

Qualtrics CX (Customer Experience)

Dashboards (BI portal for HR managers, analysts, data scientists)

Add personas:

Colleague (survey respondent)

Qualtrics Admin (builds surveys and workflows)

HR Business Manager / Analyst (consumes dashboards)

Arrows:

HRDP → Qualtrics EX

Workday → Qualtrics EX

ServiceNow → Qualtrics CX

Qualtrics EX/CX → Dashboards

Colleague → Qualtrics → (response flows)

Admin → Qualtrics EX/CX

Annotate:

Indicate SFTP (sftp.fra1.qualtrics.com, port 22, 00:30 every day)

JSON/API triggers, Qualtrics‑ServiceNow connector




-------

Level 2 (Containers – C2)
Focus on each system and its internal containers, plus integrations.

System: Qualtrics EX & CX Platform
Container: Qualtrics ETL Workflow Engine
Type: SaaS-managed container
Tech: Qualtrics ETL, Web Service API, SFTP Task

Container: Survey Engine + Workflows
Tech: Survey Flow, JSON Event trigger, ServiceNow task

Container: Dashboard & Reporting (Qualtrics-built dashboards or external BI export)

System: HRDP / Minerva

	“Workday_learning.csv → CSV prefix learning_…”
		“ServiceNow case_closed JSON → Qualtrics JSON Event (payload includes caseID, resolver, satisfaction)”		
	“Survey response → ServiceNow task create incident (if negative CSAT)”
	“Derived embedded data → branch logic → dashboard data export.”


-------------------------

Level 4 (Code / C4)
Zoom into specific tasks, fields, endpoints.

Example: SFTP Extract Task
	Name: Minerva Active Employee Import
	Description: SSH‑key authentication to sftp.fra1.qualtrics.com:22, picks prefix active_*, loads into XM Directory
	Technology: Qualtrics ETL “Extract data from SFTP files” task (port 22, key or password auth)
	T	ype: File Extractor

Example: Workday Learning Export
	Name: Workday Learning Export Job
	Description: Workday Integration Service scheduled extract of learning records, drops file learning_yyyyMMdd.csv to SFTP

Example: JSON Event Listener
	Name: CaseClosedJSON
	Description: Qualtrics Workflow action “Started when event is received”, event type=ServiceNow case_closed with JSON schema
	Tech: Qualtrics JSON Event in Survey Workflow


Example: ServiceNow Task Action
	Name: CreateIncidentIfNegative
	Description: Within Qualtrics Workflow: condition (embedded CSAT <3), task = "Create new record" on ServiceNow incident table via Qualtrics extension
	Tech: Qualtrics ServiceNow Task (OAuth integration)


Arrows for C4:
Label with specific file names/prefixes, field mappings (e.g. employeeID, department, learning_hours).
Label JSON event payload examples: { "case_id": ..., "status":"closed", "resolution_time":..., "colleague_id":...}.
Dashboard export: file or API push with responseID, embedded data fields, responses.

✅ Summary Guidance
Once you build Confluence:

C1 – draw big boxes & personas with high‑level arrows and annotation like “daily SFTP”, “JSON trigger”.

C2 – zoom into each system, show containers and inter‑container arrows.

C3 – inside each container draw main component boxes (extract, scheduler, flow engine, event handler).

C4 – zoom into a single component (e.g. SFTP Extract Task), list name, description, tech, type, protocols, file names, JSON schema, arrow labels.

Label everything with C4-style metadata (name, description, technology, type).
Use consistent icons or colors for personas, systems, containers, components, code-level elements.
Annotate arrow directions, triggers (schedule, event).
In text explanation, tie each arrow label to what data & field maps happen.
