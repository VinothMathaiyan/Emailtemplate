JIRA Summary (Title):
Create dedicated CX Analytics dashboard queue in HR Hub & enhance request form logic

Problem Statement
Currently, dashboard access requests for Qualtrics dashboards are submitted via the HR Hub portal in ServiceNow. These requests are routed to a shared queue managed by the Reporting team, rather than directly to the CX Analytics team responsible for provisioning.

This setup introduces the following challenges:

Delayed access provisioning due to intermediate handoffs

SLA breaches as requests age before being assigned to our team

Lack of notifications to the correct team upon request submission

No visibility into how many requests are being received or processed by the CX Analytics team

Manual triage effort to identify the correct approver based on dashboard type

Colleague confusion and back-and-forth regarding correct approvers and dashboard names

Additionally, the current request form does not capture:

The specific dashboard the user is requesting access to

The correct approver based on the dashboard selected

Value Creation
By implementing a dedicated queue for CX Analytics in HR Hub and updating the form logic to dynamically select dashboards and approvers:

Requests will be routed directly to the responsible team

SLA performance will improve with reduced hand-off delays

Automatic assignment and notification rules will ensure timely action

Colleague experience will be smoother, with accurate dashboard and approver info shown upfront

CX Analytics will gain better reporting visibility into volume, types of requests, SLA adherence, and trends in dashboard access usage

Business Tester
[Insert Name Here] ‚Äì ideally someone from CX Analytics who will validate the new workflow in UAT (e.g. Priya Sundaram)

As a colleague, I want to
Submit a request in HR Hub for access to a Qualtrics dashboard, and:

Select the specific dashboard from a dropdown list

Automatically see and route to the correct approver

Have the request go directly to the CX Analytics queue

Receive access quickly, without unnecessary back-and-forth or SLA breaches

Benefit

Faster turnaround and fewer delays in dashboard access

Elimination of back-and-forth due to incorrect queue routing or approver mismatch

Improved SLA compliance and better tracking of requests handled by the CX Analytics team

Ability to report and analyze trends in dashboard access provisioning

Platform / Component Impacted

ServiceNow HR Hub

Request form changes (dashboard dropdown, conditional approver logic)

Routing rules and notification settings

Queue setup for CX Analytics team

Qualtrics Dashboards

Access management process (provisioning remains unchanged, but more efficiently initiated)

Acceptance Criteria

 New dedicated queue: ‚ÄúCX Analytics ‚Äì Dashboard Access‚Äù is created in HR Hub

 Dashboard list is added to the request form as a dropdown

 Approver list changes dynamically based on selected dashboard (e.g., View ‚Üí Approver A, HR Experience ‚Üí Approver B)

 Requests route directly to the CX Analytics queue (not Reporting)

 Notifications go to the CX Analytics group upon ticket creation

 CX Analytics can track number of incoming requests, open tickets, SLA compliance

 End-to-end UAT is completed and signed off by Business Tester

Let me know if you'd like me to turn this into a Word or JIRA Markdown format, or if you want help drafting the actual approver logic or dashboard dropdown list as a table for developers.

So, in our HR, we are actually using four pillars, experience, effectiveness, efficiency, and control. I just want you to identify how this particular request fit into any of this pillar. Is it about the user experience or the process effectiveness or, sorry, effectiveness or efficiency, or is it something control? Can you please add a benefit description with which filter, sorry, which pillar it actually fit into?


ChatGPT said:
Absolutely ‚Äî your organization‚Äôs four HR pillars (Experience, Effectiveness, Efficiency, and Control) provide a useful framework for framing this request‚Äôs strategic value. Based on the nature of your request (i.e., improving the dashboard access request process), here's a breakdown of how it maps to those pillars ‚Äî and which ones it most directly supports:

‚úÖ Which HR Pillar Does This Support?
Your request contributes most strongly to the following HR Pillars:

1. Experience ‚úÖ
Why:

Colleagues face fewer back-and-forths due to missing/incorrect approvers

They get timely access to dashboards with minimal confusion

The request form is clearer, more guided, and easier to complete

Avoids frustration due to SLA breaches or unclear status

üü¢ Primary Pillar Fit: Experience ‚Äì because the change directly improves the colleague journey when requesting access

2. Efficiency ‚úÖ
Why:

Eliminates redundant queue assignment (no middleman team)

Reduces manual triage efforts to identify dashboards and approvers

Enables faster provisioning with fewer manual steps

Supports faster SLA resolution and lower cycle times

üü° Secondary Pillar Fit: Efficiency ‚Äì because the process becomes leaner and faster

3. Effectiveness
This request indirectly supports Effectiveness by enabling the CX Analytics team to better track and manage request volumes and performance, but it‚Äôs not the primary benefit area.

4. Control
This request is less about Control (e.g., compliance, audit, policy enforcement), though dynamic approver logic may help ensure correct routing in line with approval policy.

üìå Final Suggested Addition to the JIRA Ticket (Benefit + Pillar Mapping)
Strategic HR Pillar Alignment

This request primarily supports the Experience and Efficiency pillars of our HR operating model:

Experience: Improves the colleague journey by providing a streamlined, accurate, and timely dashboard access process with clear guidance and fewer delays

Efficiency: Reduces manual hand-offs, unnecessary queue sharing, and back-and-forths, resulting in faster access provisioning and better SLA compliance

Let me know if you'd like this reworded for PowerPoint, Confluence, or if you want to align it with any KPIs or metrics for your pillar tracking.
