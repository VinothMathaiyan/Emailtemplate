2. **Dashboard Management**  
   - Strengthened data accuracy and security by implementing robust user access management controls, ensuring that only authorized individuals could view or manipulate dashboard data. Regular updates to dashboards mitigated the risk of outdated or inaccurate information being used by stakeholders.

3. **Change Requests for Dashboard and Survey Access Management**  
   - By raising change requests and developing a user case for a separate queue, they ensured that dashboard and survey access management was streamlined, reducing bottlenecks and the risk of unauthorized access. This process added an additional layer of oversight to manage access-related risks.
