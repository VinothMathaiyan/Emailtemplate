Prompt for Copilot:

Please help me summarize responses for each topic in my Excel file. The file has three columns: "Response" for the actual responses, "Topics" for the mapped topics, and "Actor" for the values "People leader" and "Colleague." I'd like to create a summarized response for each topic, further broken down by the "Actor" values, so stakeholders can easily understand what users are discussing.

Here's the step-by-step approach I would like you to follow:

Read the Excel File:

Load the file and read the "Response," "Topics," and "Actor" columns.

Preprocess the Data:

Clean the text data by removing stop words, punctuation, and converting to lowercase.

Group by Topics and Actor:

Group the responses by the "Topics" and "Actor" columns.

Summarize Each Group:

For each topic and actor group, combine the responses and generate a concise summary.

Provide the Summaries:

Output the summarized responses for each topic and actor group.
