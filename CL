Please process the uploaded CSV file. The file contains a column named Response, where each response is in a separate row. For every unique Keyword, identify its related Synonyms by grouping other rows referring to the same Keyword.

Generate a table with two columns:

Keyword - The primary term that appears in the Response column.

Synonym - All other related responses corresponding to the Keyword, separated by semicolons (;).

Ensure the output groups Responses under their appropriate Keywords. For example:

If there are rows leave, vacation, holiday, and leave is the primary term, then the output will be:

Keyword: leave

Synonym: vacation; holiday.

Example Input:
Response
leave
vacation
holiday
work
job
occupation
Example Expected Output:
Keyword	Synonym
leave	vacation; holiday
work	job; occupation
