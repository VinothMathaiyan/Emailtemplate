Following up on this request raised by the HR Ops team regarding the inclusion of:

Case closure comments

Initial request comments entered by the requester

…in the HR case closure survey and associated communications via Qualtrics.

We would like to clarify that these two data points are currently not being passed from ServiceNow to Qualtrics. As a result, the Qualtrics team cannot proceed with implementing this change unless the necessary data is made available in the payload.

Please refer to the attached email from Nick, where this limitation was initially confirmed. While there appears to be some confusion—particularly where Paul mentioned that the change lies with the Qualtrics team—it is important to highlight that:

The change can only be implemented in Qualtrics if the relevant fields are first passed from ServiceNow.

Therefore, we would like to reiterate:

The responsibility to pass these fields lies with the ServiceNow team.

Implementation in Qualtrics can begin only after:

The required fields (case closure comment and requester comment) are confirmed to be available in the payload

Formal approval is received from Nick (or a designated approver) regarding the data sharing

Until then, this ticket remains with the ServiceNow team for action.

Please let us know once the data field changes are approved and implemented on the ServiceNow side so we can move forward from our end
