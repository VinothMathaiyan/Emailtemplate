I hope you are doing well.

We understand that your schedule is busy, and we truly appreciate your time and input. However, we need to consolidate user stories and requirements before our discussion with the tech team in the third week of March. If we wait until April, there is a risk that key requirements may be missed.

To ensure your needs are captured, would it be possible for you to share a high-level outline of your user story? If time constraints make this challenging, even bullet points highlighting your key business requirements for the survey tool would be immensely helpful. Our team can then expand on them and structure them accordingly.

We recognize that this is a time-consuming task, especially on short notice, but your insights are valuable in shaping the future of this tool. Please let us know if we can assist in any way to make this process easier for you.

Looking forward to your response.
