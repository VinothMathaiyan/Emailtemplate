Subject: Update on Provisioning Process and Decommissioning of [Old Tool Name]

Dear [Tech Team's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inform you about some important changes regarding the provisioning process for our tools and the decommissioning of [Old Tool Name].

As we transition to using the [New Brand Name], an enterprise-level tool, we have determined that the current provisioning process, which involves sensitive colleague information, poses a significant risk if continued with the existing approach. Due to the limited scope of users and the absence of sensitive data in our previous tool, the existing tech team was able to manage the provisioning process effectively. However, the scale and nature of [New Brand Name] involve confidential data that cannot be exposed to external teams.

Therefore, we will be handling the provisioning of admin access internally within our team moving forward. We understand this is a shift from the previous process, and I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused by not informing you sooner.

Regarding the decommissioning of [Old Tool Name], there seems to be some confusion around the process, and I apologize for the lack of clarity. We are currently unable to provide a direct point of contact for incidents related to the decommissioned tool. However, please be assured that I will investigate this matter and get back to you with more information as soon as possible.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation during this transition. If you have any concerns or questions, feel free to reach out to me directly.
