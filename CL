Performance Review System: The current system is perceived as transactional and not supportive of professional growth or career progression. There's a need for a growth-oriented approach that engages employees' potential and professional development.

Training and Communication: Miscommunication about training requirements affects performance ratings and bonuses. Clear communication and understanding of training requirements are necessary for fair evaluations.

Performance Metrics and Feedback: There's a need to enhance performance metrics to better quantify individual contributions. Including peer feedback alongside manager evaluations can provide a more comprehensive view of performance.

Talent System Usability: There's a disconnect between the talent management tools and the needs of frontline operations, particularly in retail roles where tools are primarily used for training.

Manager Sensitivity and Support: Greater empathy and training for people leaders are essential for handling sensitive situations, such as employee illness, to ensure support and compassionate responses.
