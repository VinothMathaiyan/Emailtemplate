This widget shows the percentage of journey responses rated 4 or 5 by colleagues, indicating a satisfied or very satisfied experience with the journey.
Only responses with a valid rating between 1 to 5 are considered for this calculation. "Not Applicable" responses are excluded from both the numerator and denominator.
The satisfaction score is calculated as:
(Number of 4 & 5 ratings ÷ Total 1–5 ratings for the journey) × 100
