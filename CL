This experience ensures easier navigation for all respondents, including those using assistive technologies, and aligns with WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards. It introduces features like better navigation, clear response requirements, and improved color contrast to make the survey more inclusive and user-friendly.
For those interested in the full technical details of the accessibility updates, the official Qualtrics documentation provides an in-depth overview.”

Slide 2: Why Switch from Flat Layout to the New Survey Taking Experience?
Slide Content:

Legacy Flat Layout now considered outdated

New Survey Taking Experience offers:

Enhanced mobile optimization and responsive design

Modern and cleaner user interface

Simplified survey building tools

Goal: Provide a smoother, consistent experience for respondents across devices

Script:
“Our previous Flat layout is now recognized as a legacy theme with limitations, especially for mobile users. We switched to the New Survey Taking Experience to leverage its modernized interface and better mobile responsiveness.
Beyond accessibility, this new experience simplifies survey building and delivers a smoother, more consistent user experience across all devices, making it easier and more pleasant for respondents to complete the survey.”
