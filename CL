regarding the implementation of logic to exclude Flexible Working cases from triggering the HR Case Survey upon case closure.

To summarize:

The HR Ops team initially raised a concern that cases directly handled by People Leaders (without HR Ops involvement) should not be surveyed.

However, the final decision has come from the business, and they have confirmed that Flexible Working cases should not be surveyed under any circumstances.

Therefore, no feedback collection—neither via survey nor any other form—is required for such cases.

To proceed with implementing this logic in the workflow, we need to identify the correct reference field and the corresponding value that indicates a Flexible Working case.
You had kindly agreed to help with this. Could you please confirm:

The name of the reference field to be used

The exact value(s) we should check against

Once we receive this from you, we will update the Jira ticket accordingly and include it in the estimated deliverables for this change
