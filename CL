1. User Access Management (via MyIT Request Portal / IAG-BARCPINT)

Requester fills form with:

Required user type

Business justification

Line Manager receives notification and approves

Application Owner reviews justification & role

If valid ‚Üí Application Owner approves

Provisioning Team grants access

Managed entirely with Tech Team support

2. Dashboard Access Management (via HR Hub Portal)

Requester uses Reporting team‚Äôs generic form

No dedicated queue for Qualtrics dashboards

No dropdown for selecting dashboards

No automated approver mapping

Request assigned to Reporting Team ‚Üí Forwarded to Colleague Listening Team

CL team follows up:

If dashboard name is unclear ‚Üí Follow-up with requester

If approver incorrect ‚Üí Contact correct approver

After validations, access is provisioned

Slide 2: Challenges with Current State

User Access Management (MyIT Portal)

‚ùå No JML Integration

Joiners, Movers, Leavers not tracked

System does not automatically update/revoke access

‚ùå Qualtrics not integrated with HR systems

üîÅ Manual provisioning and revocation

üïí Delayed removal of leavers ‚Üí Data security risk

üîß Requires tech & data team intervention

Dashboard Access Management (HR Hub)

‚ùå No dedicated form/queue for Qualtrics dashboard access

‚ùå Dashboard & approver not structured fields (free text only)

üîÅ Manual follow-ups with requester & approvers

Joiner/Mover/Leaver logic to be integrated using colleague HR data

Rationale for Request to ServiceNow, Tech & Data Teams

Current processes are manual, fragmented & inconsistent

Direct impact on data governance, compliance & SLA

Automation + integration will:

Improve turnaround time

Reduce errors and manual overhead

Strengthen data access control

Cross-functional ownership is critical to build a scalable, sustainable model

---------
The UofU Survey is a major, enterprise-wide engagement initiative conducted annually. As part of its execution, access to the associated Qualtrics dashboards‚Äîused by HR teams, HR Business Partners (HRBPs), and business managers to interpret and act on survey data‚Äîmust be reviewed and updated each cycle.

üßæ Current Access Management Approach
Baseline Access Provided from Previous Year

Each year, the stakeholder team shares the dashboard user list from the previous cycle with the Colleague Listening (CL) team.

Manual Exclusion of Leavers

The CL team manually cross-checks the list to remove individuals who have left the organization.

This is done by comparing the previous list against current HR records.

Validation & Role Changes

The updated list is shared with HRBPs and Business Managers for review.

They validate the removals and provide input on any role changes or updates needed:

If a user‚Äôs role has changed (e.g. moved to a new business unit), access is either revoked or adjusted.

If a new user needs access due to structural or role change, the Business Manager instructs the CL team accordingly.

Access Provisioning by CL Team

After validation and final approval from business leads or HRBPs, the CL team manually updates the dashboard access in Qualtrics.

‚ö†Ô∏è Key Challenges with Current State
‚ùå Highly manual process
Every year the access list must be rebuilt, verified, and processed manually by several teams.

‚ùå No automated feed from HR systems
There‚Äôs no live sync with HR systems to automatically detect leavers, movers, or new joiners.

üïí Time-consuming validation steps
Multiple back-and-forths between CL team, HRBPs, and business managers introduce delays and raise the risk of error.

üß© Dependent on manual knowledge and stakeholder memory
Identifying role changes and approvers depends heavily on inputs from business teams, without system-driven visibility.

‚úÖ Why This Needs Improvement
To ensure data access remains secure, timely, and accurate‚Äîespecially in a sensitive, enterprise-wide survey like UofU‚Äîwe need:

üîÑ Integration with HR systems for real-time joiner, mover, leaver (JML) updates

üóÇÔ∏è Automated user mapping based on current organizational roles and reporting lines

üì• Dynamic access provisioning workflows, reducing manual dependencies

üìä Dedicated dashboard access queue in ServiceNow (or HR Hub), with:

Predefined dashboard dropdowns


There are currently two distinct access management processes followed for the Qualtrics platform:

1. User Access Management (via MyIT Request Portal or IAG-BARCpint):
Employees who need access to Qualtrics must raise a request through the official MyIT portal or IAG-BARCpint. In the form, they must specify the type of access they are requesting and provide a business justification. This request is first routed to their Line Manager for approval. Once approved, it goes to the Application Owner who validates the justification and the requested role. If deemed appropriate, the Application Owner approves the request, and it is sent to the Provisioning Team for access enablement. This entire workflow relies on the Tech Team's infrastructure and does not integrate with any HR system for lifecycle tracking.

2. Dashboard Access Management (via HR Hub Portal):
There is no dedicated queue for Qualtrics dashboards in HR Hub. Users raise access requests through a generic reporting form that was originally meant for the Reporting Team. The form does not have specific fields for dashboard name or approver; instead, these details are often written within the free-text business justification field. When such a request is submitted, the Reporting Team initially receives it, and only upon identifying it as related to Colleague Listening does it get reassigned. The Colleague Listening team then has to follow up with the requester for missing or unclear dashboard names, and contact the appropriate approver separately to confirm authorization. This manual and fragmented process leads to delays and inefficiencies.

---To overcome the current challenges and build a secure, efficient, and scalable access management system for Qualtrics, we propose the following future-state enhancements:

User Access Management:
- Integrate Qualtrics with the organization's HR systems to enable JML-based automation. When an employee joins, moves, or leaves, their Qualtrics access should be automatically updated or revoked. This would significantly reduce manual effort and security risk.
- Establish a real-time data feed between HR systems and Qualtrics, facilitated by the Data Team, to ensure accurate user lifecycle management.

Dashboard Access Management:
- Develop a dedicated queue in ServiceNow or HR Hub specifically for Qualtrics dashboard access. This queue should include:
  ‚Ä¢ A dropdown list of available dashboards
  ‚Ä¢ Automated mapping of dashboards to appropriate approvers
  ‚Ä¢ Built-in approval workflows and automatic routing to the Colleague Listening team
- These enhancements will reduce dependency on manual follow-ups, enable faster processing, and help meet SLA targets.

Ask to Stakeholders:
- We request support from the Tech Team to develop and implement these new automated workflows and ServiceNow integrations.
- We also request the Data Team to provide a reliable and secure data feed of HR lifecycle events to support automated access provisioning in Qualtrics.



The current state of access management for Qualtrics presents multiple operational and governance challenges:

User Access Management:
- The system is not integrated with HR‚Äôs Joiner-Mover-Leaver (JML) processes. As a result, user access provisioning and revocation are managed manually. If an employee changes roles or leaves the organization, this change is not automatically reflected in the Qualtrics access control. Without real-time HR data integration, there's a significant risk that inappropriate access is retained.
- Additionally, due to the lack of automated synchronization, the manual effort required from the Application Owner and Provisioning Team increases administrative overhead and the risk of error.

Dashboard Access Management:
- The absence of a dedicated Qualtrics dashboard access queue means that all requests are routed through a generic reporting form. This form does not capture essential metadata, such as the dashboard being requested or the appropriate approver.
- There is no automated logic to map dashboards to approvers, leading to delays as the Colleague Listening team must manually reach out to both the requester and the approver.
- As with user access, there is no JML integration. This means that dashboards may continue to be accessible by users who no longer need or should have access, especially after role changes or exits.
