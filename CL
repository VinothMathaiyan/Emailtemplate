Subject: Request for Feasibility Assessment: Dashboard User Extraction and Role Provisioning in Qualtrics EX/CX

Dear Qualtrics Support Team,

I hope you are doing well.

We are currently working on enhancing our dashboard access management process for Qualtrics, and would appreciate your support in assessing the following feasibility aspects related to both the Employee Experience (EX) and Customer Experience (CX) platforms.

1. Feasibility of Extracting Dashboard Users for OneSearch Feed
We would like to explore the possibility of extracting the list of existing dashboard users along with their roles across all our EX and CX dashboards. Specifically, we are seeking to understand:

Whether it is feasible to export user-role mappings at a dashboard level from both EX and CX platforms.

If the export can be done through Qualtrics APIs or via scheduled report downloads.

Whether these exports can be automated (daily or weekly) in a format that is compatible with OneSearch provisioning.

Any documentation or references for extracting user-role metadata in bulk.

This extraction is a critical requirement to support manual provisioning during our transition to an automated dashboard access workflow.

2. Integration with External HR Tech Tool for Automated Dashboard Role Provisioning
In parallel, we are evaluating the feasibility of provisioning Qualtrics dashboard roles using our internal HR Tech request tool (outside of ServiceNow).

We would appreciate your inputs on:

Whether Qualtrics EX and CX support API-based provisioning of dashboard role access (e.g., view-only, download, line-level data access).

If such provisioning can be triggered from external tools by passing user details, dashboard IDs, and role types through secure API endpoints.

Any restrictions or platform-specific limitations that we should be aware of.

Available documentation or best practices for integrating Qualtrics dashboard role provisioning with third-party request management tools.
