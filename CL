Proposal to Use Recognition Platform and Colleague Survey Feedback in Qualtrics XM Discover

1. Business Objective
As part of the Colleague Listening and Experience team, our goal is to analyze large volumes of unstructured data to derive actionable insights at an aggregated level. To achieve this, we propose utilizing the Qualtrics XM Discover tool, a cutting-edge solution that employs advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) to interpret linguistic structures and extract themes, sentiment, and patterns from text data.

The data sources proposed for integration into XM Discover include:

Recognition Platform Comments

Colleague Annual Survey (My Voice) Feedback

Hiring and New Joiner Feedback

Using XM Discover, we aim to develop an intuitive and interactive dashboard that blends quantitative and qualitative insights in one platform. This will enable leaders and stakeholders to make timely, data-driven decisions.

2. Scope of the Proposal
We propose to integrate unstructured data from the following sources into Qualtrics XM Discover:

Recognition Platform Comments: Analyzing comments from the recognition platform to understand the relationship between recognition activity and employee engagement scores, alignment with organizational values, and emerging themes in recognition.

My Voice Survey Feedback: Identifying sentiment trends, emerging themes, and areas impacting engagement, and correlating these findings with recognition data.

Hiring and New Joiner Feedback: Detecting pain points and challenges in the hiring and onboarding experience, monitoring sentiment changes over time, and identifying potential process or system-related issues.

The outputs will be visualized in interactive dashboards, offering blended quantitative and qualitative insights for leaders, HR, and employee experience teams.

3. Benefits of the Proposal

Comprehensive Insights: Uncover hidden themes and correlations between recognition, engagement, and onboarding experiences.

Proactive Interventions: Detect potential issues early through sentiment and thematic analysis, enabling quicker action.

Blended Analytics: Access qualitative and quantitative data in one dashboard for a comprehensive view of employee experience.

Improved Stakeholder Access: Deliver self-service dashboards to leadership, HR, and experience teams for decision-making.

Efficiency and Automation: Reduce manual effort in processing and analyzing unstructured text data.

4. Why is This New?

Advanced NLP Capabilities: XM Discover’s NLP engine offers superior linguistic analysis compared to Qualtrics Text iQ, enabling deeper sentiment analysis, context identification, and discovery of hidden themes.

Blended Insights Dashboard: While Text iQ surfaces text analysis within specific survey results, XM Discover enables cross-source aggregation, blending recognition, survey, and onboarding data into one platform.

Automated, Scalable Analysis: XM Discover allows continuous analysis of live feedback streams, unlike Text iQ, which is limited to static survey responses.

5. Measures of Success

Faster Insights: Reduction in the time to generate thematic insights from unstructured data.

Stakeholder Engagement: Increase in stakeholder interaction with dashboards and frequency of data-driven decisions.

6. Maturity and Governance

Data Privacy Compliance: All data use will adhere to company data privacy policies and legal frameworks, including GDPR compliance.

Data Minimization: Only essential data points (e.g., non-PII) will be used to meet the business objectives.

Access Control: Role-based access controls will ensure that only authorized users have access to XM Discover dashboards.

Audit and Monitoring: Ongoing audits and monitoring of data usage will ensure continuous compliance with data privacy standards.

7. Key Risks and Issues

Data Privacy: Potential for PII exposure in unstructured data. Mitigation: Pseudonymization and strict adherence to data minimization principles.

Data Quality: Variability in unstructured text quality could affect NLP accuracy. Mitigation: Pre-processing and cleaning of data will be done to improve analysis quality.

No New Tool Integration Risk: XM Discover is a Qualtrics product, and we already have a Qualtrics ecosystem in place. This minimizes new risks. Mitigation: If new issues arise, they will be addressed through the company's existing issue resolution process.

8. Conclusion and Request for Approval
We seek approval from the Data Usage Working Group to integrate unstructured data from the Recognition Platform, Colleague Survey (My Voice), and Hiring/New Joiner feedback into Qualtrics XM Discover. This proposal supports the organization’s goals of enhanced employee experience and data-driven decision-making while adhering to data privacy and governance policies. The insights derived from this initiative will empower HR and leaders to take timely, impactful action.

Next Steps

Secure approval from the Data Usage Working Group.

Engage with the Data Privacy and Legal teams to align on data usage policies.

Initiate data extraction and integration processes for XM Discover.

Build the XM Discover dashboard to enable stakeholder access and usage.

We look forward to your feedback and approval.
