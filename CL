Subject: Issues with UEL (ServiceNow) and Qualtrics Integration â€“ Token Expiry and Environment Upgrade Challenges

Hi [Recipient's Name],

I hope you're doing well.

Iâ€™m reaching out to highlight two critical issues weâ€™ve been encountering with the integration between Qualtrics and UEL (our ServiceNow instance), which we use to trigger HR case closure surveys. Below is the context and detailed breakdown of the problems we are facing:

Background
We have a live integration between Qualtrics and ServiceNow that automatically triggers a survey upon the closure of an HR case in ServiceNow. This allows us to collect timely feedback on colleague experiences with the service provided.

Issue 1: OAuth Token Expiry â€“ Impacting Task Creation
Problem: We have observed a recurring pattern where the integration fails to create a task in ServiceNow every ~100 days. This issue was first noticed in November, then again in February, and most recently last week.

Root Cause Identified: The ServiceNow team investigated and confirmed that the Qualtrics refresh token is configured with a 100-day expiry. Once expired, the token is no longer valid, which leads to failures in task creation in ServiceNow.

Impact: As the task isnâ€™t created, the Qualtrics survey isn't nudged, resulting in a drop in survey response rates.

Assumptions and Gaps:

The ServiceNow team initially assumed that Qualtrics would handle token auto-refresh dynamically, but this is currently not in place.

The Qualtrics Engineering team has requested endpoint and configuration details and is now evaluating the possibility of enabling dynamic token refresh.

Temporary Workaround Proposed by ServiceNow:

Extend the token expiry duration to 200 or even 365 days.

However, this still requires manual intervention to refresh credentials before expiry and is not scalable or sustainable.

Our Ask: We request the Qualtrics Engineering team to explore and confirm if a dynamic refresh token mechanism can be implemented on your side, so this issue can be resolved permanently and the integration can be made robust.

Issue 2: Instance Connectivity Post-ServiceNow Upgrade
Background: ServiceNow undergoes regular upgrades (e.g., Vancouver, Washington DC, Utah, San Diego, and now Yokohama), typically every 4 months.

Testing Process: We use various ServiceNow environments (UAT, DEV, TEST, RTP) to validate upgrade compatibility before deploying changes to Production.

Problem Observed: After each upgrade, when we attempt to test the integration in non-production instances:

The connection between Qualtrics and ServiceNow fails.

Errors such as "connection disabled" or "invalid account" appear.

Troubleshooting Steps Tried:

Refreshing credentials using the existing setup.

Re-authenticating the same account â€” often still results in errors.

Workaround: The only successful method has been to:

Create an entirely new account in Qualtrics.

Rebuild the entire workflow and mapping from scratch, which is time-consuming and inefficient.

Our Ask: We would appreciate it if the Qualtrics Engineering team could:

Investigate why the integration disconnects after ServiceNow upgrades.

Clarify whether this is related to ServiceNowâ€™s upgrade process, token/credential handling in Qualtrics, or something else.

Propose a sustainable fix to avoid this repeated manual rework for every upgrade cycle.

Weâ€™d be grateful for your inputs and proposed next steps on both issues. Please let us know if further details or logs are required from our side to assist with the investigation.

Looking forward to your response and support in resolving these integration concerns.

Subject: Integration Issues Between UEL (ServiceNow) and Qualtrics â€“ Token Expiry, Upgrade Behavior, and Follow-up from Discussion

Hi [Recipient's Name],

Following our recent call with the Qualtrics team, as discussed, Iâ€™m documenting the key integration challenges weâ€™re facing between UEL (ServiceNow) and Qualtrics, along with the actions weâ€™re planning and the support needed. This email is intended to summarize the critical issues, outline our testing approach, and ensure alignment before the upcoming Yokohama upgrade.

ðŸ”¹ Background
We currently have a live integration between Qualtrics and UEL (ServiceNow) that automatically triggers a survey when an HR case is closed. This mechanism helps us collect real-time feedback on colleague experience post-case closure.

ðŸ”¹ Issue 1: OAuth Token Expiry Leading to Task Creation Failures
Whatâ€™s Happening: Approximately every 100 days, task creation in ServiceNow fails. This pattern has occurred in November, February, and again last week.

Root Cause Identified by ServiceNow: The Qualtrics refresh token is configured to expire after 100 days. Once expired, it leads to authentication failure, and task creation stops.

Current Impact: No task in ServiceNow means no survey is nudged, which has led to a decline in response rates.

Assumption vs Reality:

ServiceNow initially assumed Qualtrics handles token refresh dynamically, but this mechanism is not enabled in Qualtrics currently.

Next Steps:

Qualtrics Engineering is reviewing this and has requested endpoint-level details.

We strongly recommend enabling a dynamic token refresh mechanism as a permanent fix.

If dynamic refresh isnâ€™t feasible, weâ€™d like to understand how other clients are handling static refreshâ€”any industry best practices or alternate setups would be valuable to explore.

ðŸ”¹ Issue 2: Integration Disruption After ServiceNow Upgrades
Typical Process: ServiceNow upgrades (e.g., Vancouver, Utah, San Diego, now Yokohama) happen every 4 months. We use multiple instances (DEV, UAT, TEST, RTP) to validate each upgradeâ€™s compatibility with our workflows before pushing to production.

Observed Problem:

Post-upgrade, non-production instances often show disabled connections or invalid account errors.

Attempting to refresh or re-authenticate credentials using the same setup usually fails.

As a workaround, weâ€™ve had to create a new Qualtrics account and build the workflow from scratch.

Why This is Painful: Itâ€™s time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient to rebuild everything manually each upgrade.

Monitoring Plan for Yokohama Upgrade:

We are closely monitoring the pre-upgrade state of key instances (TEST, UAT, and/or DEV).

After the upgrade, we will capture and share snapshots of the before/after states if we observe failures, to help the Qualtrics team analyze logs and changes.

This will allow for root cause identificationâ€”whether the issue is due to ServiceNow behavior, token handling, or something else in the IS system.

Support from ServiceNow Team (Barclays):

They have committed to informing us with a test plan at least two weeks in advance, giving Qualtrics Engineering and Support teams time to prepare.

ðŸ”¹ Summary of Actions & Information Needed
Qualtrics Engineering to confirm:

If dynamic token refresh can be implemented.

If not, what are the best practices followed by other clients for managing static token expiry.

What may be causing instance disconnection post-upgrade, and whether thereâ€™s a solution to preserve integration across upgrades.

Barclays (ServiceNow Team) will:

Share the upgrade test plan in advance.

Continue coordination during the Yokohama release cycle.

ðŸ”¹ Environment Details (Placeholders for Reference)
We are also including account and survey references for clarity. Please find the placeholders below:

ðŸ”¸ Sandbox Environments
Account ID: [To be filled]

Surveys used:

UAT: [Survey ID / Name]
