-----------------------------------------------------
User Access Management: Glint supports role-based access control, allowing you to define different roles and permissions for users. Make sure to review and configure these roles according to your organization's needs during the transition.

Automations: Glint offers automation capabilities, but you'll need to explore how closely it matches your current workflows in Qualtrics. Custom automations may need to be re-implemented or adjusted.

Data Privacy & Anonymity: Both platforms typically adhere to data privacy standards, but it's essential to configure data pseudonymization and anonymization settings according to your compliance requirements.

Custom Features: Some specific Qualtrics features might not have a direct equivalent in Glint, so it's important to identify these gaps and determine how to address them.
-------------------------------------------

Data Migration: Ensure all historical data from Qualtrics is securely migrated to the new platform. Check data compatibility and integrity.

Integration Setup: Replicate existing integrations with HR platforms, Workday, ServiceNow, and others in Glint.

Survey Transition: Recreate existing surveys and workflows in Glint. Ensure that question types, logic, and triggers are replicated.

Training & Onboarding: Provide training for staff on using Glint. Highlight differences and new features.
