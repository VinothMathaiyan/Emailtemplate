Dear [Talent Acquisition Team/Stakeholders],

Following my discussion with AB, here are the options we have identified for measuring user satisfaction and journey for the pre-deployment service feedback. As previously acknowledged, I’ve noted the timeline for getting back to you with viable options, and this is an overview of the possibilities we’ve considered:

Challenges with Using Qualtrics EX
Volume Constraints: As per data privacy (DP) guidelines, the minimum anonymity threshold in Qualtrics EX is set to 5. If the volume is less than 5 responses, the data will not display in the dashboard.
Anonymity Flexibility in CX: While Qualtrics CX allows adjusting anonymity thresholds for specific dashboards with DP approval, Qualtrics EX does not provide this flexibility, making it unsuitable for very low response volumes.
Options to Consider
1. Direct 1-to-1 Feedback
Pros: Allows for in-depth discussions and personalized insights.
Cons: There is a risk of respondents feeling less inclined to share honest feedback due to the lack of anonymity.
Next Step: We already use this approach for the Leaver Female Survey. We can explore with the team to understand their methodology and assess its applicability for pre-deployment feedback.
2. Anonymous Survey Using MS Forms
Pros: Maintains respondent confidentiality while being easy to deploy for smaller volumes.
Cons: Without demographic data, we lose the ability to break down results by groups, which limits deeper analysis.
Next Step:
Engage MS Forms Team: We will reach out to understand their risk mitigation strategies and assess how they ensure data confidentiality and usability.
