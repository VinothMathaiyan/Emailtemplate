Verify Audience Appropriateness: The survey programmer needs to confirm with the business or product owner whether the selected audience (managers) truly participated in the pre-deployment program and assisted colleagues during their career transition. This is critical to avoid confusion or escalation if non-relevant managers receive the survey.

Ensure Audience Confirmation: A clear and written confirmation from the business is required to proceed with the survey, ensuring the identified participants are the appropriate target audience.

Survey Tool Usage: Confirm the use of MS Forms as the platform for this survey. Ensure the responses remain anonymous, and only business owners can access the reports.

Data Privacy Statement: Include an appropriate data privacy statement in the survey to comply with data protection requirements.

-------
Procurement Status

The survey programmer must confirm the current stage of the procurement process and provide clarity on when the survey is planned to launch.
Participant Consent and Data Privacy

The survey programmer must include a data privacy statement at the beginning of the survey, clearly explaining the purpose of the focus group and specifying that no personally identifiable information (PII) will be collected.
Participants must provide explicit consent, acknowledging their understanding of the purpose and data privacy terms before proceeding with the survey.
Handling Unwanted Content

The programmer must clarify how the tool will handle scenarios where participants post irrelevant or inappropriate content during focus group discussions.
Controls and measures must be in place to allow facilitators to remove such content efficiently and maintain the integrity of the discussion.

-------
Data Privacy Statement

The tech team must include a data privacy statement in their communications, ensuring that participants are fully informed about how their data will be handled.
Data Handling and Retention Details

The business must clearly outline and communicate how the collected data (email and participant bridges) will be used, where it will be stored, and the retention period for the data.
This information must adhere to the data privacy policies to ensure compliance with regulations.

Keep the Service and Collect Feedback

The service would remain in the dashboard, and feedback would still be collected.
HR Operations can filter the data if they want to calculate the satisfaction score without including this service or choose to ignore it completely based on the filter options.
Remove the Service from Feedback Surveys

This would entirely remove the service from the feedback surveys.
The downside is that it would completely miss the opportunity to gather colleagues' experience with that service.
Keep the Question, Remove the Form

The question related to the service would remain, but the form itself would be removed.
This option would require input from other teams responsible for providing data, as there's uncertainty on how it would be handled.
