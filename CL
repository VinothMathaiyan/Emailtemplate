Throughout the year, I focused on proactively identifying and mitigating risks while enhancing controls to ensure data accuracy, process efficiency, and project success. Key actions included:

Data Accuracy & Automation: Implemented automation across various tasks, including survey data validation and test case generation, significantly reducing the risk of human error and ensuring reliable outputs.

Process Improvement & Documentation: Developed and documented clear processes in Jira and Confluence, ensuring that all projects—from survey creation to dashboard building—followed standardized, repeatable steps, strengthening overall control and knowledge sharing.

Collaboration & Knowledge Transfer: Worked closely with cross-functional teams and took initiative to train colleagues, ensuring they could manage complex setups independently, thus reducing the risk of single-point dependency.

Efficiency Gains: Streamlined time-intensive tasks, such as consolidating multiple dashboards into one, reducing effort and resource use by 75%, thereby minimizing operational risks.

By consistently applying these practices, I ensured that projects were delivered with a high degree of accuracy and efficiency, while establishing a foundation of controls that can be relied upon in future projects.
