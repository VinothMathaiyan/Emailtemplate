Sure, let me break it down into clear points first.

Zoom levels to be tested: 400%, 300%, 200%, 100%, and 75%.

For each zoom level, check if the link completion (or any interactive element) is working as expected.

Test this on both Chrome and Edge browsers to ensure consistency.

Perform the select and unselect actions to verify if error messages appear correctly when needed.

Check if all questions display properly, and ensure the progress bar functions as expected at each zoom level.

Now, for the message to your team, you could say something like:

"Hi team, can anyone help with accessibility testing? We need to verify link completion and error messages at different zoom levels (400%, 300%, 200%, 100%, 75%) on Chrome and Edge. We also need to check if the progress bar and questions display correctly, and verify error messages on select/unselect actions. Let me know if you have bandwidth to assist!"
