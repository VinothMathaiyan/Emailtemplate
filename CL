**Subject:** Request for Review: Qualtrics Dashboard Pages  

Dear Team,  

I hope this email finds you well. As part of our efforts to ensure the accuracy and quality of our Qualtrics dashboard, I would like to request your assistance in reviewing specific dashboard pages assigned to each of you.  

Here’s what I need you to check for your assigned pages:  
1. **Filters**: Verify that the filters are working correctly and displaying the right data.  
2. **Numbers and Metrics**: Cross-check if the numbers and percentages are reflecting accurately based on the provided data.  
3. **Titles and Descriptions**: Ensure the page titles and descriptions make sense, are aligned with the data being shown, and are easy to understand.  

To aid your review, [X] has created a pivot table in Excel with detailed data, which can be used for value checking. Let me know if you need access to the file or any assistance in understanding it.  

### Next Steps:  
- I’ll assign specific pages to each of you shortly.  
- Please document any discrepancies or suggestions for improvement in a shared document (link to be provided).  

**Deadline:** Kindly complete your review by [insert deadline].  

Thank you for your collaboration in making our dashboard as accurate and user-friendly as possible. Let me know if you have any questions or require clarification.  

Best regards,  
[Your Name]  
[Your Position]
