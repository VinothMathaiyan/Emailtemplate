Redirects can be configured based on response selection, completion status (completed, partial, disqualified), or survey logic.
Supports different redirects based on user segments or business logic (e.g., internal employees vs. external participants).
Custom Messages:

Display custom messages before redirection, based on survey responses.
Ability to personalize messages (e.g., “Thank you for your feedback! Click here to learn more.”).
Supports rich text formatting and multilingual options for global audiences.
Conditional Redirects & Branching:

If a respondent qualifies for further engagement, redirect them to a follow-up survey or relevant content.
If a participant does not meet eligibility criteria, display a custom message and redirect to an alternative page.
If a respondent abandons the survey, provide an option to resume later with a stored progress link.
Tracking & Analytics:

Capture redirect analytics (e.g., number of users redirected, click-through rates).
Ability to track completion rates for redirected users in reporting.
Ensure that redirects do not impact survey response tracking and data integrity.
Would you like an option for embedding tracking parameters in redirected URLs for campaign performance analysis?
