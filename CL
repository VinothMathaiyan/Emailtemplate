Stepwise Advice for Building Your C4 C1 (Context) and C2 (Container) Diagrams
Step 1: Clarify the Scope and Purpose
Clearly define your main system: e.g., "Qualtrics Employee Experience and Listening Program".

Write a brief description of what this system achieves for your organization.

List the main goals of diagramming these levels (e.g., to communicate with stakeholders, map data flow, or guide integration).

Step 2: Identify Key Personas and External Systems (Context Level)
List all user personas: HR business partners, managers, journey owners, pod leads, HR experts, employees, analytics leads, brand admins.

List all external systems interacting with your main system: Workday HRDP, ServiceNow UEL, SFTP connectors, Qlik Sense, Celonis.

For each, write one line detailing their purpose/interaction with the system.

Step 3: Draw the Level 1 (Context) Diagram
Place your central system (Qualtrics EX Platform) in the middle.

Place personas (yellow) and external systems (green) around it.

Draw arrows indicating direction and purpose of each interaction:

Data input flows (e.g., HRDP → Qualtrics)

User actions (e.g., HR business partners → Qualtrics: "design surveys")

Use recommended C4 colors (yellow for people, blue for central system, green for externals).

Step 4: Break Down Major Internal Containers (Container Level)
List the internal "big building blocks" inside Qualtrics:

Survey Module (design and distribution)

Data Processing & ETL (clean/transform source data)

Employee/Contact Directory (targeting)

Analytics/Dashboard Module (reporting)

SFTP/API Connectors (secure data import infrastructure)

Customer Experience Platform (optional, for customer surveys)

Qlik/Celonis Export Module (for future exports)

Briefly describe the role/function of each.

Step 5: Draw the Level 2 (Container) Diagram
Place the main system at the center with internal containers (blue) inside it.

Position external systems (green) and connectors (gray) outside the boundary.

Draw directional arrows showing how data moves:

From external sources into SFTP/API connectors

From connectors to Data Processing

From Data Processing to Directory and Survey Module

Survey responses to Analytics/Dashboard Module

Outputs to Qlik/Celonis

Ensure alignment with C4 notation and color code.

Step 6: Describe Data and User Flows in Both Levels
Summarize for each diagram how information and control flow.

For C1: Who triggers actions, who receives surveys/reports, where data goes in/out.

For C2: Detail sequence—source data → processing → storage/targeting → survey → analytics/dashboard → output.

Step 7: Review for Completeness and Accuracy
Confirm all personas, systems, and containers are included as discussed.

Ensure all key flows are unambiguous.

Consider reviewing with a stakeholder or domain expert for validation.


For each container (e.g., "Qualtrics Employee Experience Platform"), C3 will detail the internal structure:

What modules or services exist?

How do they interact internally and with other containers?

What data stores, trigger mechanisms, APIs, or scheduled jobs are involved?

✅ Step-by-Step Guide to Build C3 for the Qualtrics Node
Let’s focus on one major container from C2—"Qualtrics Employee Experience System".

🔍 Here are the key guiding questions to build your C3:
🧱 1. Survey Module
What triggers survey creation?

Manual by HR business partner?

Automatic based on ServiceNow or Workday event?

Is there a survey template engine or a rules engine?

🔁 2. Data Ingestion & Processing
Do you use an ETL layer or automation tool before data hits Qualtrics (e.g., to calculate service length or segment employees)?

How is data validated or transformed?

Any scheduler or job runner?

🧾 3. Directory (Employee/Contact Database)
Is it updated periodically or triggered on change?

Is it deduplicated or merged if there are overlaps (e.g., Workday vs ServiceNow)?

Does it use a metadata schema?

📊 4. Analytics Module / Dashboards
Are there predefined dashboards per persona (HRBP, manager, pod lead)?

Are visualizations updated real-time or batch?

Do you push KPIs to downstream tools (e.g., Qlik/Celonis)?

📡 5. API / Connector Layer
Are there custom APIs or integrations developed (for internal orchestration or external calls)?

What protocols are used (REST/SFTP/GraphQL)?

Is there monitoring or retry logic in place?
