Unifying Colleague Listening with Qualtrics XM Discover
Objective

Create a single, trusted analytics layer for all 18+ HR colleague-listening programs (bi-annual YourView & HR Experience plus Always-On surveys like Onboarding, Exit, HR Case, Learning, Recruitment, etc.) so journey health, themes, and sentiment can be monitored in one place, with fewer manual steps and faster action.

Why XM Discover

XM Discover (formerly Clarabridge) adds enterprise-grade conversational analytics to the Qualtrics platform—classifying sentiment, effort, emotion/ intensity and intent across unstructured feedback, at scale. It’s built around Connectors, Designer, and Studio for data ingestion, modeling, and insight delivery.

Proposed Approach (How it would work)

Ingest & unify data
– Use the Qualtrics Inbound Connector to pull EX/CX survey responses into XM Discover projects (including open-text, comments, and key metadata like journey, BU, region, persona). Optionally use XM Discover Link (Inbound) to push data via REST with field mapping and transformations.

– (Future) Extend to additional listening points (e.g., email/chat transcripts, HR case notes) to enrich journey context when permissible.

Standardize the journey model
– Define a common journey taxonomy (e.g., Hire → Onboard → Learn → Perform → Recognize → Leave) and map each response to a journey, stage, population, and sensitivity flags. Qualtrics provides native Employee Journey constructs that complement this design.

Apply AI enrichments
– Turn on Discover’s out-of-the-box Sentiment, Effort, and Emotional Intensity; add Emotion classification. Tune thresholds so exec views match HR context (e.g., stricter “negative” for safety/ethics topics).

Model themes & root causes
– Build category models (topics like “Manager Support,” “Workload,” “Career Growth,” “Pay & Benefits,” “HR Case SLA,” “Tech Tools”) and use Discover’s ML topic modeling to cluster new issues. 
Qualtrics

Surface insights & trigger action
– Publish a single “Colleague Journey Lens” in Discover Studio with scorecards by journey, population, and BU; drill-downs to verbatims and drivers; watchlists and trend alerts.
– Where action is needed, use the Qualtrics Outbound Connector to push events (e.g., escalate to HRBPs, create follow-ups in Qualtrics Workflows) enriched with Discover metrics.

What stakeholders get (benefits)

One source of truth for journey health across all programs—no more hopping across 10+ dashboards. 
Qualtrics

Deeper text intelligence than basic sentiment: see effort (how hard a process felt) and emotion/intensity to prioritize fixes with empathy. 
Qualtrics
+1

Consistent taxonomy: the same themes and definitions across YourView, HR Experience, and Always-On surveys, improving comparability over time. 
Qualtrics

Faster time-to-insight: automated classification replaces manual coding; transformations handle messy fields on ingest. 
Qualtrics

Actionability: push high-risk patterns straight into Qualtrics workflows (e.g., notify journey owners when negative effort spikes in “Onboarding → Tech Access”). 
Qualtrics

Scales across EX & CX: same analytics layer for employee and service touchpoints when you’re ready, enabling outside-in and inside-out views. 
Qualtrics

Guardrails & considerations (what to plan for)

EX privacy & anonymity: configure role-based access, data minimization, and aggregation rules appropriate to HR use; verify that journey-level views uphold anonymity thresholds. (Qualtrics supports role-based access and separate EX constructs; enforce policy in model and dashboards.) 
Qualtrics

Data prep & governance: agree metadata contracts (journey, segment, sensitivity), retention, and redaction for PII within verbatims before ingestion. 
Qualtrics

Model tuning: initial time is required to seed category models and calibrate sentiment/effort thresholds to HR language; plan periodic QA. 
Qualtrics

Scope creep: Discover is powerful; keep phase 1 focused (YourView + HR Experience + 2–3 Always-On programs) before expanding. 
Qualtrics

Phased path (high level)

Phase 0 (POC now): Continue onboarding POC; validate sentiment/effort/emotion accuracy on Onboarding survey. 
Qualtrics

Phase 1 (Foundation): Stand up connectors for YourView & HR Experience; implement journey taxonomy; publish the unified Journey Lens. 
Qualtrics
+1

Phase 2 (Scale): Add Always-On programs; tune category models; wire outbound events to Workflows for proactive actions. 
Qualtrics

Phase 3 (Extend): Consider additional channels (e.g., HR case notes) where policy allows, to close the loop faster. 
Qualtrics

Bottom line: XM Discover lets you consolidate all colleague-listening text into one governed, AI-powered analytics layer—bringing journey-level insights, sentiment/effort/emotion signals, and automated actions together so Journey Owners and Board Leads see issues sooner and fix them faster.
