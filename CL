1. User Access Management (via MyIT Request Portal / IAG-BARCPINT)

Requester fills form with:

Required user type

Business justification

Line Manager receives notification and approves

Application Owner reviews justification & role

If valid → Application Owner approves

Provisioning Team grants access

Managed entirely with Tech Team support

2. Dashboard Access Management (via HR Hub Portal)

Requester uses Reporting team’s generic form

No dedicated queue for Qualtrics dashboards

No dropdown for selecting dashboards

No automated approver mapping

Request assigned to Reporting Team → Forwarded to Colleague Listening Team

CL team follows up:

If dashboard name is unclear → Follow-up with requester

If approver incorrect → Contact correct approver

After validations, access is provisioned

Slide 2: Challenges with Current State

User Access Management (MyIT Portal)

❌ No JML Integration

Joiners, Movers, Leavers not tracked

System does not automatically update/revoke access

❌ Qualtrics not integrated with HR systems

🔁 Manual provisioning and revocation

🕒 Delayed removal of leavers → Data security risk

🔧 Requires tech & data team intervention

Dashboard Access Management (HR Hub)

❌ No dedicated form/queue for Qualtrics dashboard access

❌ Dashboard & approver not structured fields (free text only)

🔁 Manual follow-ups with requester & approvers

🕒 Delay in meeting SLA timelines

❌ No lifecycle-based access (Joiner/Mover/Leaver)

Slide 3: Future State – Proposed Improvements

✅ User Access Management Integration

Connect Qualtrics with HR JML data

Automate access provisioning/revocation

Enable system-level sync with MyIT or other request platform

Prevent orphaned users & reduce manual workload

Tech Team + Data Team required to establish data feed & automation

✅ Dashboard Access Management Workflow Enhancement

Create dedicated queue for Qualtrics dashboards in HR Hub

Form improvements:

Dashboard name → dropdown selection

Approver auto-mapped based on dashboard

Reduce back-and-forth and requester confusion

Auto-routing to correct team (Colleague Listening)

SLA compliance improvement

Joiner/Mover/Leaver logic to be integrated using colleague HR data

Rationale for Request to ServiceNow, Tech & Data Teams

Current processes are manual, fragmented & inconsistent

Direct impact on data governance, compliance & SLA

Automation + integration will:

Improve turnaround time

Reduce errors and manual overhead

Strengthen data access control

Cross-functional ownership is critical to build a scalable, sustainable model

---------
The UofU Survey is a major, enterprise-wide engagement initiative conducted annually. As part of its execution, access to the associated Qualtrics dashboards—used by HR teams, HR Business Partners (HRBPs), and business managers to interpret and act on survey data—must be reviewed and updated each cycle.

🧾 Current Access Management Approach
Baseline Access Provided from Previous Year

Each year, the stakeholder team shares the dashboard user list from the previous cycle with the Colleague Listening (CL) team.

Manual Exclusion of Leavers

The CL team manually cross-checks the list to remove individuals who have left the organization.

This is done by comparing the previous list against current HR records.

Validation & Role Changes

The updated list is shared with HRBPs and Business Managers for review.

They validate the removals and provide input on any role changes or updates needed:

If a user’s role has changed (e.g. moved to a new business unit), access is either revoked or adjusted.

If a new user needs access due to structural or role change, the Business Manager instructs the CL team accordingly.

Access Provisioning by CL Team

After validation and final approval from business leads or HRBPs, the CL team manually updates the dashboard access in Qualtrics.

⚠️ Key Challenges with Current State
❌ Highly manual process
Every year the access list must be rebuilt, verified, and processed manually by several teams.

❌ No automated feed from HR systems
There’s no live sync with HR systems to automatically detect leavers, movers, or new joiners.

🕒 Time-consuming validation steps
Multiple back-and-forths between CL team, HRBPs, and business managers introduce delays and raise the risk of error.

🧩 Dependent on manual knowledge and stakeholder memory
Identifying role changes and approvers depends heavily on inputs from business teams, without system-driven visibility.

✅ Why This Needs Improvement
To ensure data access remains secure, timely, and accurate—especially in a sensitive, enterprise-wide survey like UofU—we need:

🔄 Integration with HR systems for real-time joiner, mover, leaver (JML) updates

🗂️ Automated user mapping based on current organizational roles and reporting lines

📥 Dynamic access provisioning workflows, reducing manual dependencies

📊 Dedicated dashboard access queue in ServiceNow (or HR Hub), with:

Predefined dashboard dropdowns

Auto-assigned approvers

Lifecycle logic to manage access over time
