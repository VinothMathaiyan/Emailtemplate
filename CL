I would like to provide an update regarding two issues we encountered with the Manager-Led survey setup and the actions taken:

Issue 1: Quota-Based Report Scheduling Logic

In the Manager-Led survey, we set a threshold for report scheduling: once a line manager has 3 survey completions, a workflow triggers an email containing a report link, scheduled to be sent at survey closure.
However, we identified a problem â€” when multiple respondents (e.g., the 4th and 5th) complete the survey simultaneously, the quota count can jump directly from 3 to 5 without passing through 4 incrementally. As a result, the workflow that was designed to trigger at exactly 3 completions fails to initiate for these managers.

The support team confirmed that this is expected behavior due to how the system handles concurrent completions and unfortunately, no standard fix is available. They advised handling such cases manually.

To minimize manual intervention, I proposed an alternate solution:

Pull the Response ID of the manager (requestor) and introduce an embedded data field, 'Report Sent', initially set to 'No'.

Modify the workflow trigger condition to:

Check if the quota count is greater than or equal to 4 (instead of exactly 3).

Verify that 'Report Sent' is 'No'.

Upon meeting the trigger conditions, the workflow will:

Schedule the report.

Update the 'Report Sent' field to 'Yes' for the manager.

This approach ensures that even if the quota count jumps (e.g., from 3 to 5), the report is triggered only once per manager and avoids multiple workflow runs as the 'Report Sent' field controls repeated execution.

This solution has been reviewed and approved by Alisdair, and I have now implemented it. I would appreciate your support in testing the logic to confirm it works as expected across different scenarios.

Separately, we also addressed the link expiry issue for the scheduled reports, which was resolved and tested last week. The report links are now functioning without expiration concerns.

Issue 2: Calendar Accessibility

The calendar (date picker) component built by the support team is not fully accessible. Upon raising this, the support team clarified that accessibility checks for custom-coded components must be completed before project sign-off. After sign-off, they are unable to offer fixes for such items.
Despite exploring all potential solutions, no feasible fix was found without significant redevelopment. As a result, we will proceed with the current setup.

Please let me know if you would like me to arrange a session to walk through the updated logic and testing
