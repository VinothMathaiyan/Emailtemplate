Dear [Cybersecurity Team],

We have received your notification regarding the upcoming expiry of an SSO certificate by the end of August. As per the note, the certificate in question appears to be from the vendor ‚Üí organization direction (in addition to the organization ‚Üí vendor certificate, which we recently updated and embedded in the vendor‚Äôs platform).

To investigate, we contacted our vendor (Qualtrics). After checking at their end, they confirmed they are not able to recollect or identify any existing process or record involving a certificate issued from their side to our organization for SSO purposes. They have reviewed possible configurations but found no matching reference in their systems.

Given this, we request your help to:

Backtrack the certificate details ‚Äì when it was last updated, who was involved, and any related documentation or process records in our systems.

Clarify the nature and purpose of this vendor ‚Üí organization SSO certificate.

Identify potential owners or stakeholders within the organization who might have handled the previous issuance or update.

Advise on next steps to mitigate any risk from the expiry, especially if the vendor is unable to trace the certificate on their side.

Recommend an approach to ensure service continuity and prevent disruption if the certificate expires without replacement.

Since the expiry is approaching and the vendor currently cannot confirm the certificate details, we need a swift response to avoid potential SSO disruptions. Please let us know if you need additional inputs from the vendor or our team to expedite this.

Thank you for your support and guidance on resolving this matter.

Clarification on Granular (Row‚Äë/Column‚ÄëLevel) Access Control for Employee vs Contact Directories

Dear Qualtrics Support Team,

We recently performed testing in our sandbox environment to understand the behavior and implications of Granular Access Control‚Äîspecifically, Employee Record Access Control (row-level restrictions) and column-level (data access) tags, introduced around two years ago.

Summary of findings to date:

The employee directory access controls (row restrictions, import controls, and data access tagging) operate as expected, limiting project admins in EX projects to specified employees (e.g., by department or region) when using the global employee directory, in accordance with official documentation 


However, contact directory (CX directory) and dashboard data restrictions were not impacted by these settings. Project admins can still view response data and use dashboards unaffected, since data access tags only prevent individual field-level visibility and exports; aggregate dashboards remain visible if thresholds aren‚Äôt breached 

We confirmed: enabling Employee Record Access Control only affects import behavior via the global EX directory. It does not restrict:

viewing or downloading CX directory contacts

access to dashboard data in CX projects

or metadata fields outside EX context

Clarification requests:

Is there a plan to extend row-level or column-level controls to the Contact (CX) Directory or CX Dashboard viewers?

If we enable Employee Record Access Control in production:

Will privileged users (approx. 140) require manual or automatic role assignment? What happens if a new global directory user has no role‚Äîwill they lose access (e.g. import)?

Are there any unintended consequences (e.g. for dashboard access or data export) when the feature is enabled for employee data only?

During testing, we observed that:

If files include blocked sensitive headers (such as ‚ÄúGender‚Äù), those rows are rejected unless the uploaded file renames them (e.g. ‚ÄúGender New‚Äù), which introduces additional columns. This impairs bulk imports.

Are there best practices or mitigations to prevent this (e.g. header mapping, configurable error handling)?

Given our recent contact deduplication effort‚Äîfrom approximately 800,000 records down to 150,000‚Äîwe need reassurance of strong control over duplicates going forward:

What measures are currently implemented for duplicate prevention or automatic merging in the Contact Directory? 


Could you share your timeline for deploying enhancements or control measures for directory hygiene across both contacts and employees?

We had discussed these points last week, and I want to ensure we have documented alignment before enabling this feature in production. If needed, I can schedule a call this week with the relevant team where I‚Äôll loop you in.

Please let me know:

If any testing gaps need to be addressed

What additional limitations or mitigations we should plan for

Your estimated timeline or next steps for support or implementation engagement

Thank you for your assistance. Looking forward to your respons

 Clarification & Guidance on Granular Access Control (Employee vs Contact Directory)

Dear Qualtrics Support Team,

I‚Äôm reaching out to seek clarification and guidance following our recent sandbox testing of Granular Access Control, including both row-level (Employee Record Access Control) and column-level data access tagging.

Key Observations from Testing:
The Employee Directory (EX) is responsive to row-level access controls and column-level tagging. These configurations restrict import/view access based on user roles and data tags as expected.

However, we found that these controls do not extend to:

  The Contact Directory (CX) ‚Äì i.e., customer records in CX are not affected by row-level restrictions.

  Dashboard-level access or exports ‚Äì users could still view and download aggregate data without restriction.

Based on testing, only importing through the global employee directory is impacted. Users must be assigned to specific roles to import data when access control is turned on.

  Concern: We currently have ~140 privileged users. Assigning roles manually for all of them and ensuring the same for any new users could become operationally heavy.

Additionally, we observed that:

  If a sensitive field (e.g., ‚ÄúGender‚Äù) is tagged as restricted, imports containing that exact header are blocked.

  Renaming the header (e.g., ‚ÄúGender New‚Äù) allows import but creates unintended duplicate columns, potentially affecting downstream reporting or integrations.

What We Need from You:
We are not planning to implement this in production at this stage. However, before proceeding with next steps (internal discussions and planning), I need your input on the following:

Could you confirm if our understanding is correct ‚Äî that Contact Directory and dashboard access are not impacted by row-/column-level controls?

Are there any additional limitations, exceptions, or configurations in row-/column-level control that we may have missed during testing?

What are the best practices or workarounds to prevent issues like unintended duplicate fields during imports (e.g., due to sensitive field blocking)?

As discussed earlier, you mentioned that control measures will be put in place for managing duplicates in the Contact Directory.

Could you share what those control mechanisms are or will be?

Once shared, I intend to schedule a session with our privileged users (those who frequently import contacts) to walk them through the expected process and these safeguards.

Please let me know your availability so I can include you in that session.

Given the recent duplicate cleanup effort (from ~800,000 down to 150,000 records), we want to sustain this hygiene.

Do you have any insights or recommendations for preventing duplicate contacts at the point of import?

Any visibility settings or automation available that could flag or stop duplicates?

In summary, I‚Äôd appreciate:

Your confirmation on the technical boundaries of granular access control

Any missed points in our testing

Your guidance on how best to move forward, especially around contact hygiene and process standardization

Looking forward to your response and support in aligning the next steps with our stakeholders

I‚Äôm following up on our discussion from last week regarding the ability to export dashboard user lists from Employee Experience (EX) and Customer Experience (CX) platforms‚Äîand the feasibility of automating this via API.

üîç Context & Challenge
We previously queried whether dashboard user lists from both EX and CX could be exported via API rather than manually through the user interface.

The requirement is urgent: our Request Access Control (RAC) expires within six months, and typical exceptions granted by the request team don‚Äôt extend beyond one or two months.

Manual extraction, deduplication, and merging of dashboards user files (multiple platforms) is time-consuming and unsustainable on a daily basis.

Key Requests
We need clarity urgently to proceed with dashboard access management via the request platform:

Feasibility of API-Based Export

Can Qualtrics provide an API endpoint that exports a unified file for dashboard users from both EX and CX environments?

Is there precedent or documentation supporting this type of automation? 
qualtrics.com
+10
qualtrics.com
+10
qualtrics.com
+10

Automated File Preparation & Role Merging
If the API is feasible:

Can we receive one merged file with unique user records across both platforms?

Additionally, can dashboard role assignments be consolidated into one file column to simplify role-based provisioning and revocation processes?

Survey Flow / API for Access Revocation via Survey

We‚Äôd like to explore whether a survey-flow‚Äëtriggered API process can revoke or provision dashboard roles automatically (e.g., input a unique ID/‚Äúbread‚Äù value in a survey, triggering removal of access).

This would reduce manual effort and streamline dashboard access management.

Priority & Timeline
This item is high priority. We need to confirm feasibility before proceeding with request-based dashboard provisioning.

We need Qualtrics support to be actively involved in extracting, merging, and sharing these files.

Timeliness here is critical due to the RAC expiration and reliance on manual processes.

Action Needed
Please confirm whether the above API-based solutions are feasible within Qualtrics.

If feasible, can you share:

Sample API endpoints or documentation

Expected response formats (e.g. unified CSV/TSV output)

Any limitations or prerequisites

Let me know how soon you can get back to us‚Äîideally this week‚Äîso we can schedule a call if needed and share the access control workflow with privileged users accordingly.

Thank you for your attention and support. I look forward to your response.

Urgent: Investigation Required for Repeated Data Privacy Consent Prompts

Dear Qualtrics Support Team,

I‚Äôm writing to request your immediate support regarding an issue we identified related to the data privacy consent mechanism.

Issue Summary:
During our recent review, we noticed that certain users‚Äîover 100 individuals‚Äîhave received multiple consent prompts on the same day, which is not aligned with the expected behavior. For some, the consent was logged more than 80 times within a one-month period, which indicates a serious deviation from intended functionality and negatively impacts user experience.

Expected Behavior:
As discussed in our last call, the ideal scenario is:

Consent should be requested only once every six months.

Even if the user accesses the platform via different browsers or after clearing cookies, they should not be prompted again within the six-month window.

In our internal testing, this behavior held true for most cases; however, the exceptions observed in the Excel file indicate inconsistencies that warrant investigation.

Request:
Please investigate why certain users are being prompted multiple times for consent, even within a short span of time or on the same day.

Check if there are known issues with cookie settings, browser behavior, or user identifiers that might cause consent to reset unexpectedly.

Advise on how this issue can be mitigated or prevented going forward to ensure a smooth and compliant experience for users.

Supporting Data:
I have placed the Excel file with the observed patterns in our shared Interlinks folder at the following path:
üìÇ [Insert actual path here]

Kindly refer to it for examples of the repeated consent entries.

Additional Request:
To further our internal analysis, could you please:

Share the most recent consent data (for the last six months), ideally with the following details:

Consent timestamp

User identifier (or hashed ID)

Source (e.g., browser/platform/environment if available)

This will help us determine if the pattern is continuing or expanding, and ensure compliance with privacy standards.

Priority:
We consider this issue high priority, given its potential impact on both user experience and data privacy obligations. A prompt response and fix would be appreciated.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. Please let me know if you need any further context or if a call is needed to walk through the file.

Overview
We recently reviewed business requirements with Microsoft Teams for enabling HR Experience Survey delivery and functionality. The response from the Microsoft Teams/Glenn team includes a mix of clear and unclear feasibility items.

üß© Key Observations from the Initial Review
Requirement Area	Response Summary	Clarification Needed
Customization (Fonts, Color, Style)	‚ùå Not supported. Only default branding options (e.g., logo) can be applied once and reused.	‚ú≥Ô∏è Confirm extent of branding possibilities.
Randomization Features	‚ùå Block, event, and random assignment logic are not supported.	‚úÖ Critical to clarify alternate mechanisms to preserve journey distribution logic (e.g., 11 journeys shown per user).
Integration with Workday / HRDP	‚ö†Ô∏è No direct connector. API via SFTP possible.	‚úÖ Feasibility, effort estimation, and replication for our use case need review.
Real-time Test Case via ServiceNow	‚ùå Not supported.	‚úÖ Need alternative approach or workaround discussion.
Question Types	‚úÖ Supports basic types: single select, multi-select, open text only.	‚ú≥Ô∏è Confirm if other formats (e.g., sliders) can be mimicked or adapted.
Other Items (100+ Requirements)	Mixed responses: some are clear; many are ambiguous, incomplete, or imply additional effort.	‚úÖ Require clarification from the Microsoft team directly.

üó£Ô∏è Recommendation
Propose a 1-hour clarification call with the Microsoft/Glenn team to:

Walk through ambiguous or complex responses

Identify effort level, feasibility, and support availability

Decide on viable alternatives or mitigations

Request Microsoft to come prepared with:

Clarifications for all 100+ items

Recommendations or known workarounds for gaps

A plan for potential follow-up discussion, if needed

üìå Risks Without Clarification
Inability to implement event-based logic for surveys may directly impact user experience and survey design integrity.

Integration feasibility and data flow assumptions remain unclear without technical input.

Multiple ‚Äúpossible but unclear‚Äù answers delay decision-making on platform selection and design planning.

------------------
 hope you're doing well.

Following our recent review of business requirements for enabling the HR Experience Survey via Microsoft Teams, I‚Äôd like to summarize where we currently stand and request a one-hour clarification call to address outstanding questions.

üîç Summary of Observations:
While some responses from the Microsoft Teams team were clear (either feasible or not feasible), many items remain ambiguous and require further explanation. Out of 100+ items reviewed, a significant number need clarity on feasibility, effort required, and whether support from your side is possible.

Key Points:
Customization Limitations:
Microsoft Teams does not support styling customization (e.g., font, color). Only default branding (such as logo placement) is supported globally and applied once across services.
‚Üí We‚Äôd like to confirm the full extent of what's customizable.

Randomization Logic (Critical for HR Survey):
Event-based or block randomization (used for showing 11 journeys per user) is not currently supported.
‚Üí We need to discuss how this can be handled or emulated.

Integration with Workday / HRDP:
No native connector exists, but integration is possible via API and SFTP.
‚Üí Clarification needed on feasibility and replication in our environment.

ServiceNow Real-Time Test Case:
Direct real-time integration was marked as not supported.
‚Üí What alternate methods can be considered?

Question Types Support:
Currently limited to single select, multi-select, and open text.
‚Üí We‚Äôd like to explore whether other formats (e.g., sliders) can be approximated.

üó£Ô∏è Request:
To proceed confidently, we request your support in scheduling a 1-hour clarification call where we can:

Walk through the unclear or partial responses

Understand feasibility and technical effort required

Confirm if your team will be able to support the proposed work

Discuss any workarounds or alternate solutions

If needed, we are open to scheduling a follow-up session.

‚ö†Ô∏è Why This Is Urgent:
Without clarity, we may face risks such as:

Inability to deliver an experience aligned with our survey logic

Delayed decisions on platform and design

Manual workarounds for unsupported features (e.g., dashboard logic, integrations)

Your support in providing definitive answers will help us determine the next steps for implementation and planning.

Please let us know your availability for the call this week or early next. We appreciate your continued support and collaboration.
