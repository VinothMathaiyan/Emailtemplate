🔧 Refinement of Text iQ Model for Deeper Topic Analysis in Onboarding Journeys

Description:
The current Text iQ topic model was created over three years ago and may no longer reflect the language and system landscape accurately. It lacks the granularity required to enable stakeholders and dashboard users to drill down into specific stages such as hiring or new joiner experiences. Additionally, several existing topics may be outdated, no longer relevant, or misaligned with recent changes in system setup, communication flow, and terminology.

We are initiating a refinement exercise to fully leverage the capabilities of Text iQ and ensure alignment with actual user experience and feedback. This includes reviewing current topics, updating keywords, and introducing stage-specific subtopics to improve topic precision and insight generation.

This work will be done collaboratively with the Data Science and Behavioral Science teams and will cover two primary services under the Onboarding journey:

Hiring Manager Experience

New Joiner Experience

The refined topics will also be implemented in XM Discover, and a summary page will be created for stakeholder reference and dashboard usage.

Acceptance Criteria:
 Requirement explained and clarified with Data Science team

 Data Science team presents initial approach and logic

 Feedback loop established to refine draft model

 Finalized stage-specific topics and keywords for Hiring & New Joiner

 Feedback gathered from journey owners and incorporated
