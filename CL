We propose using the Qualtrics XM Discover tool to make sense of large amounts of free-text feedback from employees. This tool analyzes comments to uncover key themes, sentiment, and trends, helping us identify pain points, improve processes, and find connections, like how recognition impacts engagement. The goal is to create an easy-to-use dashboard that gives clear, actionable insights to improve colleague experiences.

The proposal focuses on leveraging Qualtrics XM Discover to analyze unstructured feedback from colleagues at an aggregated level. The primary goal is to derive actionable insights that align with organizational values and improve processes.
The proposal targets large volumes of unstructured text data, such as open-ended comments from surveys and recognition platforms. This is a voluntary initiative from internal stakeholder aiming to enhance colleague experiences through better understanding and actionable insights enabling efficient decision-making and process improvements.
