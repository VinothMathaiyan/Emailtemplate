I’ve implemented the three-option multi-select consent specifically for China, where users must select all three to continue. For all other countries, the flow remains as-is without a consent requirement.

Just to clarify, we’ve included an alert message in the question text to highlight that all three options must be selected to proceed. If none are selected, there's a default feature in the system that prompts the user to confirm whether they want to continue or skip.

Because we can’t enable both skip logic and triggers simultaneously, this approach ensures the user experience is smooth without disabling the back button.

Please let me know if the language or wording of the consent statement needs any adjustments or if there’s any feedback on the current setup before we proceed.
