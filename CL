Survey Platform Strategy & RFP Initiative – Executive Summary
Background & Context
The current enterprise-wide contract with Qualtrics (used across HR and non-HR functions) expires in December 2026.

Given integration complexities (e.g., ServiceNow, Workday), population growth, and limitations in automation and access control, we are initiating a Request for Proposal (RFP) to evaluate future-fit survey platforms.

Initial engagement with Viva Glint was inconclusive; product gaps and insufficient vendor engagement prompted escalation and the need for formal vendor comparison via an RFP.

Strategic Intent of the RFP
Benchmark three potential providers: Qualtrics, Viva Glint (Microsoft), and Workday PECON.

Evaluate solutions based on:

Lifecycle integration (Workday PECON)

Analytics & AI (Glint)

Flexibility & advanced analytics (Qualtrics)

Ensure alignment to comprehensive technical and business needs including:

SSO, integration, data migration, customization, access controls, scale formats, and AI roadmaps.

Clarify roles, responsibilities, and governance across HR and non-HR teams to support complex business requirements and tool adoption.

Procurement, Governance & Risk Management
Procurement (Tom Carter) confirms contract renewals typically start 6–12 months in advance.

Carter will raise a Coupa request with a 3-year placeholder value, following standard sourcing governance (demand challenge & CIO review).

Surendra (Procurement) supports compliance through Coupa routing and coordination.

Escalations with Microsoft are underway to address Glint's lack of engagement and to align sourcing timelines given overlapping Microsoft renewals.

Risks:

Potential duplication of effort if late vendor responses coincide with renewal decisions.

Delay in RFP may impact continuity of critical services like YourView, Team Feedback, and 360 Feedback.

Survey Platform Strategy & RFP Initiative – Executive Summary
Background & Current Context
Our enterprise-wide contract with Qualtrics, the current survey platform, expires in December 2026.

The solution supports both HR and non-HR use cases, with dependencies on projects like 360 Feedback and YourView.

A prior review with Viva Glint to assess alignment with business needs was initiated but remained incomplete, uncovering product gaps and integration limitations.

This prompted the recommendation from Procurement (Tom Carter) to initiate a Request for Proposal (RFP) and concurrently explore early renewal with Qualtrics to ensure continuity and allow a fair vendor evaluation process.

Strategic Intent of the RFP
Evaluate market solutions including Viva Glint, Workday PECON, and Qualtrics.

Ensure alignment to technical, business, and compliance requirements, including:

Single Sign-On (SSO), automated access controls, customization, scale types, survey frameworks, AI capabilities, data migration, historical access, and integration with tools like SurveysNow.

Capture a future-ready roadmap from vendors, particularly in the domain of AI-led colleague listening.

Address current tool limitations, support long-term needs, and reduce transition risks.

Key Milestones & Timeline
Milestone	Target Date
Finalize RFP scope & requirements	July – August 2025
RFP issued to shortlisted vendors	September 2025
Vendor review & selection	Q3 2025
Decision on future platform	Q4 2025
Final cutoff for Qualtrics decision	End of Q2 2026
Platform transition & implementation	H2 2026 – 2027

Governance & Stakeholder Engagement
Working Group includes HR and non-HR product owners, technical SMEs, and cross-functional colleagues.

RAS provides advisory support (not project management).

Paul Clemmes appointed as Project Manager to lead planning, stakeholder coordination, and RFP execution.

Procurement (Tom Carter) to guide early renewal process and ensure compliance with governance protocols.

Risks Identified
Delay in vendor analysis (e.g., Microsoft Glint’s gap review) risks tool selection and migration timelines.

Lack of RFP experience could slow execution; hence multiple examples are being sourced to guide format.

Potential misalignment between tool capabilities and current survey frameworks (e.g., 10-point scale support, benchmarks).

Ask from Ex-Co
Endorse the RFP strategy and timeline to allow structured vendor evaluation and timely platform decision.

Support early renewal discussion with Qualtrics, enabling parallel sourcing and safeguarding delivery risks.

Sponsor stakeholder alignment and reinforce the importance of a unified enterprise-wide approach to colleague listening
