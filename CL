Project Description for Lean Control Platform Onboarding
Tool: Qualtrics Survey Platform
Owner: [Your Team / Department Name]
Product Type: Third-Party SaaS Tool
Primary Purpose: Colleague Listening & Employee Experience Surveys
ðŸ”¹ Overview of the Product and Business Use Case
Qualtrics is a third-party survey and experience management platform used extensively across our organization to support and scale colleague listening initiatives. It forms the central platform for collecting employee feedback, monitoring sentiment, and capturing insights that support continuous improvement of the employee experience.

The tool is used to design, distribute, and analyze various employee surveys across the lifecycle of a colleagueâ€™s journeyâ€”from onboarding to exit. These surveys play a vital role in understanding engagement, learning effectiveness, organizational support, and HR service quality.

ðŸ”¹ Survey Types in Scope
The following surveys are actively managed within the Qualtrics platform:

Always-On Lifecycle Surveys

Onboarding Experience Survey

Exit Survey / Leaver Experience

Learning & Training Feedback Surveys

Mandatory Training Feedback Surveys

Ad Hoc Feedback Surveys for special initiatives

Scheduled Programmatic Surveys

YourView Survey (Bi-annual Enterprise-Wide Engagement Survey)

HR Experience Survey (Bi-annual pulse on HR service effectiveness)

Targeted Pulse Surveys â€“ driven by organizational or strategic events

These surveys enable leaders and HR to take data-driven actions and are essential for meeting strategic goals related to engagement, retention, onboarding effectiveness, and and HR service quality.

ðŸ”¹ No-Code / Low-Code Model
While Qualtrics is a feature-rich platform, it operates under a no-code/low-code model for end users. There are no development or custom software code changes made by the internal product team. Instead, survey designs are created via:

Drag-and-drop question builders

Predefined logic flows

Manual content upload (from stakeholder-approved documents like Word files)

Utilization of built-in dashboarding and analytics tools

All configuration changes are performed within the platform UI by trained survey adminsâ€”there is no direct source-code or application-level development involved from our organization.

ðŸ”¹ Integrations Involved
Although the product itself is a SaaS solution, integrations with internal systems justify its inclusion in the Lean Control platform:

ServiceNow:
Integrated to trigger surveys post-HR case closure (via API/Workflow), supporting real-time feedback loops.

Workday / HRDP / Data Alley:
Integrated for operational metadata, such as employee role, department, region, and lifecycle events (e.g., start date, end date), enabling targeted feedback and segmentation.

SFTP Integration:
Used to share or receive feed files for privileged user access and automated record updates.

These integrations ensure secure, governed, and consistent experience data pipelines, which are vital for downstream dashboards and stakeholder reporting.

ðŸ”¹ Why Qualtrics Needs to Be Onboarded to Lean Control (LCT)
Despite being a third-party platform with no internal coding, Qualtrics must be onboarded to the Lean Control Tool (LCT) due to:

Third-party data handling responsibilities involving sensitive employee feedback.

System integrations with HR and IT platforms which fall under architecture and data governance review.

Regular enhancements and configuration changes that impact how data is collected and reported.

Continuous operation and organizational impact â€“ Qualtrics is used across all regions and functions and is business-critical for both HR and People Strategy teams.

ðŸ”¹ Change Management & Risk Consideration
Changes made within the Qualtrics tool are:

Configuration-based only (no software development).

Approved internally via stakeholder alignment before launch.

Logged and maintained within internal Confluence documentation.

Tested in pre-production environments where applicable before rollout.

The risk level is low from a technical deployment standpoint but high in terms of reputational and business continuity if the tool is misused or data breaches occur. Thus, controlled access and visibility through LCT is justified.

ðŸ”¹ Business Justification / Impact
Supports strategic HR and People Analytics programs.

Enables real-time feedback from over [insert number] employees globally.

Drives action planning, EX improvement, and continuous listening culture.

Supports regulatory compliance (GDPR, Works Council feedback norms).

Improves colleague engagement, onboarding satisfaction, and retention.

ðŸ”¹ Next Steps & Request for Approval
We request the engagement and architecture teams to:

Review the product capability and integrations outlined.

Acknowledge the no-code nature of configuration changes.

Approve Qualtrics for inclusion into the Lean Control Platform (LCT).

Confirm governance steps for documenting any future enhancement changes.

If youâ€™d like this draft formatted into a formal Word or Confluence document, I can provide that too.

Let me know if you'd like to tailor it further to your specific audience or tribe.
