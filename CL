Slide 1 – Option 1: Fully Manual
Category	Details
Request Handling	Requester raises access request in Request portal → dashboard names shown in dropdown → approval flows automatically to Line Manager and Business Owner.
Provisioning Method	Manual provisioning by Colleague Listening Team in Qualtrics system. Roles assigned manually after approval.
File Extraction (OneCert)	Required daily.
Steps: extract from CX & EX → combine → convert to .txt → import.
Time: ~ 8 hours/day.
Automation Scope	None. Entire process is manual.
Dependencies	- IAM team & Request team for form build
- RTB team for IDSI name (confirmed within 5 days)
- Tech team risk exception approvals
- HR risk team for ORAC acceptance.
Effort & Timelines	- File preparation: 8 hours/day.
- Provisioning: 2–3 hrs per week per resource during releases.
- Request team can deliver form logic in 3–5 weeks.
- Can go live immediately after form build.
Cost Impact	None (no integration / custom build).
Reporting Capability	Not required / not available.
Feasibility (EX vs CX)	Works, but high effort since both CX and EX exports must be combined daily.
Pros	- Immediate implementability.
- No external build cost.
- Moves away from ServiceNow → centralized Request portal with automated approval flow.
Cons / Pain Points	- Very resource intensive.
- Not scalable with 18+ HR dashboards.
- Risk for movers (SSO ensures leavers drop off, but movers retain access incorrectly).
- Must raise exceptions & ORAC for risk acceptance.
- Error prone due to heavy manual handling.

Slide 2 – Option 2: Hybrid (Partial Automation)
Category	Details
Request Handling	Same as Fully Manual: Request portal + dropdown dashboards + Line Manager + Business Owner approvals.
Provisioning Method	Manual provisioning by Colleague Listening Team (same as manual).
File Extraction (OneCert)	Target for automation.
- Extraction of user file automated via Qualtrics API or custom build.
- Current status: Not feasible with standard Qualtrics API.
- Would require custom engineering.
Automation Scope	Partial – only OneCert file extraction automated. Provisioning remains manual.
Dependencies	- IAM team & Request team (form).
- RTB team (IDSI name).
- Qualtrics Engineering Team for custom API solution.
- MFT Team for SFTP connection (Qualtrics → DTU → IAM system).
- Tech team approvals for risk & integration.
Effort & Timelines	- File preparation effort: 0 (automated).
- Provisioning effort: still manual (2–3 hrs/week per resource, spikes to 2–3 hrs/day during major releases).
- Timeline: uncertain; 12–24 weeks depending on Qualtrics custom build feasibility.
Cost Impact	High. Custom Qualtrics engineering + MFT integration build.
Reporting Capability	Not currently available.
Feasibility (EX vs CX)	- CX: extraction more feasible (global).
- EX: complex, as roles are project-based, not global; requires project ID.
Pros	- Removes daily 8-hour effort for OneCert file preparation.
- Reduces manual workload and errors.
- Known process (we already do manual extraction, only automation replaces it).
Cons / Pain Points	- Still manual provisioning.
- Custom build dependency on Qualtrics Engineering (no standard API).
- High cost + long timelines.
- Complexity higher for EX.
- Multi-team dependency (Qualtrics, IAM, MFT, Tech).

Slide 3 – Option 3: Fully Automated
Category	Details
Request Handling	Same as other options: Request portal with dropdown dashboards + automated Line Manager & Business Owner approvals.
Provisioning Method	Fully automated via Qualtrics APIs integrated with Request + IAM system. No manual provisioning required.
File Extraction (OneCert)	Not required – direct provisioning through API removes dependency on OneCert file.
Automation Scope	End-to-end automation (request → approval → provisioning). Includes JML integration for automatic de-provisioning of movers/leavers.
Dependencies	- IAM & Request team for form.
- RTB team (IDSI name).
- Qualtrics Engineering Team to confirm EX & CX provisioning feasibility.
- Barclays Tech Team for integration enablement & feasibility check.
Effort & Timelines	- Ongoing manual effort: minimal (only exception handling in case of failures).
- Timeline: 3–6 months (integration build + testing).
Cost Impact	Moderate – lower than hybrid since no SFTP/file transfer infra needed, but integration build still required.
Reporting Capability	Can be embedded in Request system logs + Qualtrics API logs.
Feasibility (EX vs CX)	- CX: provisioning feasible at global level.
- EX: feasible but requires passing project ID. Further validation needed with Tech & Qualtrics.
Pros	- Future-proof & scalable (works across all HR dashboards).
- Eliminates manual file handling.
- Eliminates manual provisioning.
- JML ensures movers/leavers handled correctly.
- Reduces errors + provides audit trail.
Cons / Pain Points	- Integration feasibility must be validated (Tech + Qualtrics).
- If APIs not viable, fallback is costly custom build.
- Timeline longer (3–6 months).


----
Theme	Current Challenges	Limitations (Qualtrics Response)	Feasible Approach (Org Policy & Request Team)
Scalability	Manual process for dashboard access across multiple HR products (18+) is not scalable.	API returns user details only at project level (not global) – making centralized management difficult.	Use Request system for centralized handling with dropdown of dashboards.
Efficiency	High dependency on manual intervention; prone to delays.	No single API to fetch all dashboards users have access to across EX/CX.	Automating via Request forms with mapped approvers streamlines efficiency.
Auditability	No proper logs or audit trail when managed manually.	Audit trail limited to project-specific API calls; lacks enterprise-wide traceability.	Request can automatically maintain approval logs and audit records.
Access Management	Handling approvals separately in ServiceNow is fragmented.	API allows access provisioning at project level only, not at org/global level.	Request can integrate line manager approval automatically + designated approver workflow.
Future-readiness	Current process will break at scale with new EX/CX use cases (Engagement, Exit, Learning, etc.).	Qualtrics APIs are not designed for global role-based provisioning.	Request team is positive about building a scalable form-based solution aligned with org standards.

---

Slide 1 – Option 1: Fully Manual
Request Handling & Approvals

Requester raises access request in the Request portal.

Selects the required dashboard from a dropdown list.

Request flows through line manager approval → business owner approval.

Request system is fully feasible — team confirmed 3–5 weeks to configure.

Provisioning Method

After approvals, request is passed to the Colleague Listening Team.

Provisioning is performed manually in the Qualtrics system.

Each role assignment is configured individually.

File Extraction

OneCert file generation is mandatory.

Extract user details separately from CEX and EX platforms.

Files must be manually combined, converted into .txt, and then imported.

This process takes ~8 hours/day of dedicated effort.

Automation Scope

No automation possible.

All steps, including file handling, provisioning, and approvals, are manual.

Dependencies

Request team for form creation.

RTB team for generating new IDSI name (business justification needed, ~5 days).

Exception handling → Tech team & HR risk team (ORAC submission).

IAM File Delivery (Feasibility)

Delivered manually; no automation in CEX or EX.

Reporting Capability

Not available in this model.

Effort Required

~8 hours/day for file extraction and provisioning.

Additional time for exception handling.

Highly resource-intensive and error-prone.

Cost Impact

No external build required.

No direct financial cost, but high hidden operational cost due to FTE dependency.

Timeline

Immediate start possible after form build (3–5 weeks).

No dependency on external teams beyond request & RTB.

Pros

Can be implemented immediately.

Low/no external cost.

Moves away from ServiceNow into standardized Request system.

Cons / Pain Points

Non-scalable approach.

Very resource-intensive (8 hours/day).

Risk of errors in manual file preparation.

Movers (role changes) continue to hold dashboards post-transfer → risk accepted via ORAC.

High dependency on exceptions and manual handling.

Slide 2 – Option 2: Hybrid / Partially Automated
Request Handling & Approvals

Same process as Fully Manual:

Dashboard selected via dropdown in Request form.

Approvals via line manager + business owner.

Request system logic confirmed feasible.

Provisioning Method

Provisioning still manual in the Qualtrics system.

Colleague Listening Team applies the access changes.

File Extraction

Proposed automation of OneCert file (instead of daily manual prep).

Would require Qualtrics engineering custom build, as no public APIs exist for EX/CEX user extract.

Also requires SFTP setup: Qualtrics → DTU → IAM server.

Dependencies include Qualtrics engineers + MFT team.

Automation Scope

Partial (limited only to file extraction).

Provisioning remains manual.

Dependencies

Request team + RTB team (same as fully manual).

Additional dependency:

Qualtrics engineering for custom API/file extract solution.

MFT team for file transfer pipeline (SFTP).

IAM File Delivery (Feasibility)

Uncertain — depends on custom build.

No current support for automated extract from EX/CEX.

Reporting Capability

Not supported; would require additional custom engineering.

Effort Required

If file extract is automated → saves ~8 hours/day.

Provisioning still manual → estimated 2–3 hours/week per product.

During major HR Experience/YourView releases → ~2 hours/day for 10–15 days.

Cost Impact

High: Custom engineering from Qualtrics required.

Additional cost for secure SFTP setup and ongoing support.

Timeline

Longer: 12–24 weeks (3–6 months) depending on Qualtrics engineering availability.

Dependent on feasibility of API and SFTP connection.

Pros

Reduces significant workload by eliminating daily OneCert file preparation.

Moves part of the process into automation.

Reuses known steps and processes (file extract logic already understood).

Cons / Pain Points

Still resource-intensive due to manual provisioning.

Custom engineering dependency → cost, timeline risk.

Complex EX role/project structure makes extraction harder.

Multiple team dependencies: Qualtrics, MFT, IAM, RTB.

Not guaranteed feasible (Qualtrics has not committed APIs).

Slide 3 – Option 3: Fully Automated
Request Handling & Approvals

Same front-end process: Request form with dropdown dashboards, approvals by line manager + business owner.

Fully feasible within 3–5 weeks by Request team.

Provisioning Method

Fully automated provisioning via Qualtrics API integration.

No manual intervention required once approvals are completed.

File Extraction

Not required (system integration bypasses OneCert files).

Eliminates 8 hours/day manual task and SFTP dependency.

Automation Scope

Full automation: request, approval, provisioning, JML integration.

Dependencies

Request team (form build).

RTB team (IDSI name creation).

Qualtrics engineering + Organization Tech team for API enablement, feasibility, and integration build.

Joint testing and validation required.

IAM File Delivery (Feasibility)

Not applicable (no file-based process).

Reporting Capability

May require custom build from Qualtrics (pending their scoping).

Not available natively today.

Effort Required

Minimal ongoing effort.

Only required in case of integration failures or incident handling.

Cost Impact

Moderate: API integration + coordination effort.

Lower than hybrid (no SFTP/file pipeline setup).

Higher than manual (custom development required).

Timeline

Estimated 3–6 months to design, test, and validate integration.

Requires full alignment between internal Tech team and Qualtrics engineering.

Pros

Scalable and future-proof.

No manual file handling or provisioning.

Seamless integration with JML processes.

Reduces risk (no movers retaining dashboards).

Minimal FTE dependency.

Cons / Pain Points

High dependency on integration feasibility.

If Qualtrics API cannot fully support EX project-level provisioning, solution may fail.

Cost and complexity higher upfront.

Longer lead time to deliver compared to manual option
