Thanks for clarifying, Rajasekar! Let me refine the workflow with this update:

### **Workflow for Pre-Processing and Text Analysis**

#### **1. Input File**
- **Source:** HREx Survey Free Text Data.
- **Contents:** Raw pretext responses from the HREx survey.

#### **2. Pre-Processing (Using Python)**
- Clean data by:
  - Removing punctuations, special characters, numbers, and irrelevant words.
  - Converting multiline responses into single-line text for better readability.

#### **3. Splitting Large Data Files**
- **Challenge:** Copilot has a character limit of 80-90 words.
- **Solution:** Use Python to split the HREx survey data into 5 smaller Excel files for smoother processing.

#### **4. Text Analysis Using Copilot**
- Input: Split files.
- **Outputs Produced:**
  - **Mapped Excel File:** Text responses organized into stages and topics.
  - **Insights Excel File:** Extracted data providing actionable insights based on stages.

#### **5. Creating Word Document**
- Input: Mapped Excel file with text responses.
- **Output:** Word document summarizing key topics and providing concise actionable insights.

#### **6. Generating Presentation**
- Input: Word document.
- Process:
  - Use Copilot to create a PowerPoint deck.
  - Incorporate manual adjustments to ensure alignment with stakeholder needs.
  - Present main topics and subtopics for action-oriented decision-making.
