Subject: Need Approval for Personal Email IDs for Instant Leavers

Hi [Recipient's Name],

I'm reaching out to follow up on X's request from yesterday about getting approval to use personal email IDs for instant leavers. We need this approval because it was part of the initial project plan. We've also reminded the team about this need and raised two tickets, but we still haven't received the personal email IDs.

Because of this delay, we're losing around 7% of responses each month. This makes it hard to track our progress and update stakeholders.

Could you please prioritize this request and give us the needed approval? It will help us improve our accuracy and efficiency.

Thank you for your help.
