**Subject:** Urgent Escalation: Prolonged System Slowness Issue Impacting Deliverables  

Dear [Recipient's Name or Team],  

I am reaching out to escalate a system slowness issue that has persisted for over four months. Despite multiple checks and involvement from various teams, there has been no resolution to date, and the problem has only worsened. Below is a summary of the issue, its impact, and actions taken so far:  

### **Teams Involved**  
[List of Teams]  

### **Current State**  
- Initially, the system functioned in the office environment, but now the issue persists both at home and in the office.  
- A recent suggestion to switch from IPv6 to IPv4 for home connectivity remains untested due to my office-based work last week. However, the issue persists in the office environment as well.  
- Teams have confirmed my system health is good, and I have changed laptops thrice, reinstalling all necessary software each time, which has been time-consuming and inefficient.  

### **Impact on Work**  
- **Deliverables:** Significant delays in meeting deadlines due to the slowness.  
- **Quality:** On a few occasions, such as with [X survey], system errors like a white screen in the participant view led to assumptions that tasks were complete, compromising quality.  
- **Efficiency:** A substantial amount of time has been wasted on repetitive troubleshooting and system setup.  

### **Escalation Request**  
Most of the time, the issue has been handed off between teams without resolution. Given the ongoing impact, I kindly request immediate assistance in resolving this matter. Any further insights or actions your team can recommend would be highly appreciated.  

Please let me know if additional details are required from my end to expedite the resolution process.  

Thank you for your attention to this matter.  

Best regards,
