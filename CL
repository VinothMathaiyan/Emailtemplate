Today
Hey, Vinoth!

So, what's new today, Vinoth?

Hi, hope you're well. I have...
and help me to...
organize the content.
Absolutely, I'd love to help you organize your Confluence page. Let's start with outlining the main sections you have in mind. What key topics or categories are you thinking about including?

Great

Sure, so this Confluence page is going to be inputs for the detailed instructions of the requirement to
Got it.

Right, OK, so the the objective is that they wanted to work on text data and give us.
a few outputs to us, the output we expected is.
Keywords
the topics.
the text data.

The response data so maybe I will just walk you through.
the survey questions that we have.
We have a support hiring manager survey
We have
Alright, and so we extract those free text.
and provide them the various free states of each free text response file.
is for the specific stage.
like applying for
the, uh, sorry, the, you know, just up reviewing the CVs received and, uh, uh.
Qualified candidate detail as another free text response. The experience of hiring managers is what we are trying to say, collect.
Yeah, we'll provide to them.
with the stages.
And the data science team need to provide the topics.
with respect to the responses we received.
Meaning, let's say that the colleague talking about the system pain point or.
the organization's pain points or the process.
or in any technology, technology thing. So by reviewing the responses.
and relevant keywords.
The relevant keyword should be like a maybe like a unigram or bigram or trigram. So the idea is.
The responses should map to the right.
the right topic that's created.
Thank you.
And it can also fall under multiple topics because the colleague may also speak about system pain point and also the organization behavior. So it is possible.
that the responses can fall under multiple stages, so it is OK, but the keyword should be more relevant, but the topic mapped.
This is the output. I wanted to walk them explain them in the confluence page. What is our exact output we are looking for? What we will provide them and how the output should look like. So with this content, please help me to draft.
Absolutely. We'll organize the Confluence page into sections like Objective, Inputs, Expected Outputs, and Output Formats. Does that sound like a good structure to you?

Yes.
Let's draft it then! First, the Objective: Clearly state that the goal is to analyze hiring manager survey responses to extract key topics and relevant keywords. Moving on to Inputs: Describe the data you'll provide, like free-text responses at various stages of the hiring process. For Expected Outputs, explain that you're looking for identified topics and relevant keywords, specifying the use of unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams. Finally, Output Formats: Indicate how the results should be presented, emphasizing relevance to the topics and flexibility for multiple topic mapping. How does that sound so far?

Great.
Awesome! Now, let's flesh out each section with some details and clarity. For the Inputs, you could specify the types of questions and stages in the hiring process. Under Expected Outputs, elaborate on how the data science team should present the topics and keywords, maybe suggesting formatting or examples. Anything specific you'd like to include?

Let's detail those sections then, Vinoth. Under Expected Outputs, you could mention the need for clear, concise keywords and topics, complete with examples, and for Output Formats, specify the layout and structure, like tables or graphs. Ready to give it a go?

You
Mm-hmm.

Bye.
Mm-hmm.

Excellent. This looks interesting. So I have a few more points to add. So I will just walk you, explain you the stages.
about the free text response in the hiring manager. So we have the.

is the eighth one.
and welcoming the new colleague during the first week.
Peace. Dubbed. Duh.
9 to 1.
And finally, overall experience.
as the 10th one. So can you also include the stages? I mean, there are.
Got it. I'll add a section listing those stages, from "Seeking Business Approval" all the way to "Overall Experience." This will clarify the scope of the analysis for each stage in the hiring process. Shall we include this in the Inputs section, under a subsection for stages?

Of course you can do and I think I missed one more in the preparing to receive the new colleague.
And the second

The next is...
Mm-hmm.

Mm-hmm.

There is another free text response. Please give me a minute. What are the specific? Okay, the specific challenges that the colleague
Faced
when they onboard is the another free text.
Got it. I'll

So, could you please include all this?
Absolutely, Vin

Absolutely. We'll include those two additional responses under "Preparing to Receive the New Colleague": "Preparing to Onboard the New Joiner" and "Specific Challenges Faced During Onboarding." Ready for anything else?

Um
No, not anything. So if we could provide a final confluence page with all this detail in one go, that would be a great help.
