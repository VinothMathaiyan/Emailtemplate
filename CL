Following our session on February 25th, where we discussed the Qualtrics survey user and stakeholder needs and the upcoming license expiration in 2026, we wanted to check in on your progress with drafting user stories. As these will play a crucial role in shaping our future requirements, we would like to ensure you have the necessary support in structuring or refining them.

To gain a deeper understanding of your perspectives and priorities, we would appreciate the opportunity to schedule a 30-minute discussion at your convenience. This will help us align the requirements effectively when engaging with the tech team and supplier. Please let us know your availability, or feel free to book a suitable time via [insert scheduling link if applicable].

Your insights are invaluable to this process, and we truly appreciate your time and support.

Looking forward to your thoughts.
