## Presentation Structure

### 1. Introduction
- Highlight the importance of analyzing free text responses.

### 2. Business Problem
- **Challenge:** Lack of specificity and difficulty in deriving actionable insights from generic topics like "Experience" or "Services."
- **Need:** Mapping responses to specific stages in a process, making them more relatable and actionable.

### 3. Stakeholder Expectations
- Explain the need to map responses to specific stages in a process.

### 4. Process Stages for Annual Leave
- Detail the stages of the annual leave process:
  1. Access Workday platform
  2. Review guidance and leave allocations
  3. Review balance
  4. Select leave dates
  5. Add notes (if necessary)
  6. Submit request
  7. Manager review and approval
  8. Make adjustments (if necessary)
  9. Notification of decision to manager
  10. Update Workday calendar
  11. Track and report

### 5. Current Solutions
- **Mapping Responses:** Using TF-IDF vectorizer method to map responses to specific topics.
- **Identifying Subtopics:** Cluster analysis to identify subtopics within responses.
- **Visualization:** Creating word clouds and bar charts for visual representation.
- **Summarizing Responses:** Parsing mapped responses and summarizing comments for stakeholder review.

### 6. Detailed Steps in Mapping Topics
1. **Input File:**
   - **Sheet 1:** Annual leave responses
   - **Sheet 2:** Keyword dictionary
   - **Sheet 3:** Moment responses

2. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Convert text to lowercase
   - Remove text in square brackets, punctuations, and words containing numbers
   - Remove underscores, periods, slashes, colons, and equal signs
   - Lemmatize text
   - Remove stop words and non-alphanumeric tokens

3. **Keyword Dictionary:**
   - Prepare keyword dictionary to standardize terminology
   - Replace synonyms with common keywords for consistency

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Analyze the number of words in responses
   - Create word clouds and bar charts for visual representation

5. **N-gram Analysis:**
   - Examining unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams to see word frequency patterns.

6. **TF-IDF Mapping:**
   - Each response is mapped to specific topics using TF-IDF.
   - Random checks suggest good accuracy, with potential for improvement through refining the keyword dictionary and applying machine learning for continual updates.

### 7. Clustering Analysis
1. **Subtopic Creation:**
   - Using clustering analysis to create subtopics.
   - Input is the processed output from TF-IDF mapping.

2. **Data Processing:**
   - Similar cleaning and processing are applied, with a focus on cluster creation.

3. **Optimal Cluster Identification:**
   - Business needs determine the number of subtopics.
   - Methods like Silhouette Analysis help find the optimal cluster number.
   - Manual testing suggests three clusters for the "Access to Workday" topic.

4. **Cluster Refinement:**
   - Further refinement is possible to enhance accuracy.

### 8. Visualizations
- **Visualization Creation:** Creating word clouds and bar charts to represent data visually.
- **Visualizations:** Help in understanding and communicating key insights from the data.

### 9. Future Steps
- **Qualtrics Integration:**
  - Moving the processed file into Qualtrics for further analysis.
  - Using Qualtrics dashboards to drill down based on the team.
  - Performing sentiment analysis for deeper insights.

- **Automation and Refinement:**
  - Optimizing the number of clusters.
  - Enhancing efficiency and accuracy through automation.
  - Reducing manual effort and minimizing errors.

### 10. Benefits
- **Faster Topic Mapping:** Allowing quicker identification of trends in large volumes of data.
- **Reduced Manual Intervention:** Saving time and ensuring reliability.
- **Enhanced Accuracy:** Through continual updates and refinements.
