Slide 1: Critical Path Table (with Sophia's Highlights)
#	Decision Required	Pre-Socialization	TEP	TRB Pre-Brief	HRXCO	Critical Path / This Decision Informs
1	Scope & Purpose
Target audience from 2026+
Question set + LEAD framework alignment	WBxC 14 July	25 July	TBD	17 Sept	• Impacts tooling complexity, build vs buy
• Q1–Q2 2025: Requirement gathering completed (53+ journeys, 360)
• Tool feasibility assessment scheduled for Q3 2025
• TEC architect appointed; PM onboarding underway
2	Enduring Governance
Who decides, where it sits	WBxC 14 July	25 July	TBD	17 Sept	• Enduring decision-making structure for future tools
• Stakeholder ownership clarity needed
• Architect lacks prior expertise – support model planning required
3	Dual Deployment Strategy
360 cycle timing	WBxC 14 July	25 July	TBD	17 Sept	• Aligns with current practice: Q4 = IB (VP/AVP), Q1–Q2 = Bank-wide Dev 360
• Avoids tool duplication; relies on staggered rollout
• Qualtrics to remain as backup during parallel POC
4	Technology Platform & Requirements	TBD	13–28 Aug	TBD	17 Sept	• Platform build begins Q2 2026 (user roles, data flows)
• Glint deprioritized due to integration gaps (no GTIS role access, no BA)
• Targeted Qualtrics exit: December 2026
• Must support legacy data migration and APIs (Workday, ServiceNow, HRDP)









Slide 2: Consolidated Summary – Rox & Meera Insights
🔁 Dual deployment refers to timing, not to using multiple tools. It's about phasing 360 cycles (IB in Q4, Dev in Q1–Q2), not duplicating work.

🧩 Leverage existing Qualtrics 360 — already built, trusted, and embedded — rather than introduce new complexity prematurely.

📅 The realistic transition to a new platform is 2026, after POC validation, technical integration, and governance setup.

🛑 RFP language must avoid implying the future is decided — strategy is evolving and co-owned by tech, HR, and listening teams.

🎯 Future tooling (like Glint) must be fit-for-purpose; not selected just because it exists. Needs must drive the choice, not availability.

🤝 Work must be co-created across HR, Tech, and Listening, prioritizing simplicity, compliance, and enterprise alignment.

Original Idea	After Incorporating Sophia’s Points
Impacts feasibility of delivery on tech platform.	• Platform build begins Q2 2026 (user roles, data flows)
• Glint deprioritized due to integration gaps (no GTIS role access, no BA)
• Targeted Qualtrics exit: December 2026
• Must support legacy data migration and APIs





Row	Decision	Corrections (in “Critical Path / This Decision Informs”)
1	Scope & Purpose	➕ “Q1–Q2 2025: Requirement gathering across HR completed”
➕ “Q3 2025: TEC prioritized RFP and Glint review scheduled Oct–Nov 2025”
2	Enduring Governance	➕ “Q4 2025: Awaiting confirmation from TEC and Procurement on scope/governance direction”
3	Dual Deployment	➕ “Q3–Q4 2026: MyVoice rollout on new platform, Qualtrics retained as backup”
4	Platform & Tech	➕ “Q1 2026: POC and solution architecture”

➕ “2026 Dec: Final exit from Qualtrics”



FINAL, REFINED SUMMARY SLIDE (Slide 2)
Title: Consolidated Strategic Summary – Rox & Meera

Bullet Points:

🔁 Dual deployment refers to timing, not using multiple tools — Q4 for IB, Q1–Q2 for development needs.

⚙️ Avoid duplicating 360 processes or tools — current Qualtrics solution is capable and embedded.

🛑 Future tooling decisions (e.g., Glint) are not yet finalized — planning must reflect that this is still exploratory.

🧠 Strategic alignment across Tech, Listening, DCW is key to ensure seamless 2026 rollout without fragmentation.

✅ Any new platform must prioritize off-the-shelf, regulated solutions with minimal customization.

🎯 Co-created, phased approach avoids confusion, reduces tech sprawl, and protects colleague experience.






 Let's restate the 3 content sources to be integrated:
🔄 Rox & Meera Email (360 Commentary)
✅ You want only very high-level messaging — no duplication, just one or two key directional inputs reflected in the slide.
➤ E.g., No new 360 process; reduce duplication and maintain colleague experience.

📩 Tom Carter Email
✅ Add key action point: raise Coupa request as first step in onboarding a new vendor
✅ Note: Vendor onboarding takes ~9 months, work backward from Dec 2026

📅 RFP 5-Step Framework (From shared RFP process)
✅ Reflect 5 RFP stages:

Working Group

Prepare Pack

Issue Pack

Evaluate

Decision & Award
✅ These are aligned to quarters: Q3–Q4 2025 and transition starts 2026

✅ RECOMMENDED SLIDE CHANGES – CRITICAL PATH
Your existing slide has two swimlanes or columns (like below):

Quarter	Viva Glint Track	Survey Tool RFP Track
Q1 2025	Requirements gathering	-
Q2 2025	Playback & sign-off	-
Q3 2025	Glint assessment, updated requirements	🆕 Start RFP – Working Group & Requirements Gathering
🆕 Raise Coupa Request (Tom’s input)
Q4 2025	Gap analysis & onboarding planning	🆕 Issue RFP & Evaluate Responses
🆕 Tool Decision Finalized
🆕 CL Team Training Begins
Q1 2026	Architecture sign-off, integration planning, POC	🆕 Architecture Sign-Off
📌 Rox/Meera Input: Avoid new 360 rollout to reduce duplication
Q2 2026	Data prep, migration begins	Data Preparation & Migration
Q3 2026	System config, integration	System Config & Tool Integration
Q4 2026	Pilot, rollout, exit Qualtrics	New Tool Pilot & Exit Qualtrics

✅ KEY POINTS TO ADD INTO THE SLIDE TEXT ITSELF:
For Q3 2025 (RFP Row):

“Begin RFP process: establish working group, start business requirements capture”

“Raise Coupa request for new vendor onboarding (Tom Carter)”

“Plan resource allocation — vendor onboarding may take ~9 months”

For Q4 2025 (RFP Row):

“Issue RFP, evaluate vendors (Glint, Peakon, Qualtrics)”

“Tool decision finalized and team training initiated”

For Q1 2026 (RFP Row):

“Architecture plan, integrations, and data flows”

🔄 Note from Rox/Meera: “Avoid duplicative 360 deployment — use existing solutions to ensure consistency and reduce tech load”

For Header/Footnote of the Slide (Optional):

“Survey Tool RFP follows ANZ’s 5-step process: working group setup, pack preparation, issue/evaluation, vendor selection, and award.”

“Plan is synchronized to exit Qualtrics by Dec 2026”

✅ VISUAL CUES YOU CAN USE:
Add 📌 or 🔄 icons next to points like Tom’s note or Rox's governance input

Keep swimlanes clear (one row for Glint, one for RFP)

Emphasize where two paths converge (e.g., integration & rollout in Q3/Q4 2026)

📎 FINAL QUICK SUMMARY
Source	What to Add
Rox & Meera	Just one line in Q1 2026: “Avoid duplicating 360 rollout – leverage existing tool”
Tom Carter	In Q3 2025: “Raise Coupa request – 9-month onboarding window”
RFP Process Steps	Align your existing Q3–Q4 2025 RFP tasks under 5 key RFP stages
