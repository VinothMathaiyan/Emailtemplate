I wanted to provide an update regarding our upcoming call initially scheduled to discuss the ServiceNow Yokohama upgrade and the connector fix by the Qualtrics team. As per the latest update from the ServiceNow team, the Yokohama upgrade will require an additional week. Consequently, we are looking at rescheduling our call to the third week of June.

However, before we finalize this new schedule, I want to bring to your attention a recurring issue that has been affecting our integration between Qualtrics and ServiceNow. Over the past six months, we have encountered frequent credential refresh issues. The most recent occurrences were on November 29, 2024, mid-February 2025, and once again in the past week. This issue has led to failed task creations due to unauthorized errors, requiring us to re-establish the connection by refreshing the same credentials multiple times.

Despite raising this concern with both the Qualtrics and ServiceNow teams, we have not received a clear response or accountability regarding the root cause. This lack of resolution is impacting our workflow and integration efficiency.

Therefore, I propose that during our rescheduled meeting, we focus on discussing this credential refresh issue in detail. Our primary objective should be to identify the root cause and determine a sustainable solution.

In addition to discussing the credential refresh issue, I would like to include some additional questions that have come up from the ServiceNow team:

Why is Qualtrics not requesting a new refresh token dynamically from ServiceNow?

Is there a design misunderstanding that requires the token to be static? If so, we need to discuss updating the token validity to a longer period and scheduling regular activities to refresh it, as per other integrations.

To effectively address these points and understand the backend design perspective, I propose we have the engineering or design teams from both Qualtrics and ServiceNow join the call. This will help us drill down further on the issue and explore any potential design or engineering considerations.

Please let me know your availability for the third week of June so we can finalize the schedule.
