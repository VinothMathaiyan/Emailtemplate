Email 1 – Proposal for XM Discover

Subject: Proposal to Extend XM Discover Usage Across HR Journeys

Dear [Recipient],

I would like to clarify that our proposal to use XM Discover is not limited to candidate surveys (hiring manager and new joiner feedback). We are bringing a broader perspective by extending it across key HR programs and journeys, including:

HR experience

HR journey experience

HR case experience

Recruitment, onboarding, learning, exit journeys

Future external data sources (if required)

This approach will help us identify real pain points, understand interconnections, and generate additional insights from a consolidated view in one place. XM Discover will enable us to:

Perform advanced text analysis across all HR products

Identify trends and drivers

Build a unified taxonomy and text model for HR products

Support future roadmap items, such as EA and conversational chat analysis

In summary, we are proposing that journey owners and stakeholders leverage XM Discover for broader HR insights rather than focusing only on recruitment.

Thank you for your time and support in reviewing this proposal.

Best regards,

Email 2 – Update on Current POC & Next Steps

Subject: Update on POC and Next Steps for HR Text Model

Dear Deji,

Thank you for your time last week – the session was very insightful. I wanted to share a quick update on the ongoing program:

We are planning to close the current POC once approval is received.

Next steps include building a consolidated view across HR products and updating the taxonomy.

A single text model will be created to support HR journeys (recruitment, onboarding, learning, HR cases, exit).

I may not be able to connect today due to another session. However, I will share my insights summary with the onboarding team next week, and I will also submit my questions and inputs to you by Friday evening or latest by Monday morning. This will give you at least a day to review before my call with Anthony on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, I’ll continue updating the text model and share progress with you.

Thanks again for your support, and please take care.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

Email 3 – Tech Team Resource & Meeting Scheduling

Subject: Coordination on Tech Resource Allocation and Meeting Scheduling

Dear [Recipient],

I have a call scheduled tomorrow with the tech team to confirm resource availability for our integration requirement. Based on that discussion, I will schedule a separate call to go through the exact requirement and feasibility for dashboard access management.

To help with scheduling, could you please share your availability for the following slots?

This week: Thursday, Friday

Next week: Monday, Tuesday

We will need about 30–45 minutes for this discussion, and I will also include the tech team to address feasibility questions directly.

Unfortunately, due to my sessions after the weekly call, I may not be able to connect at the usual time, so it would be helpful if you could propose a convenient time in the above windows.

Thank you for your flexibility and support.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
