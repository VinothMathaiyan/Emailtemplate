I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out regarding the recent request for recertification of the single sign-on method for [tool name].

Our organization uses multiple brands of the same tool, and I realize this might have caused some confusion. To clarify, if your team does not use the single sign-on method and instead uses password-based credentials to log in, kindly disregard this request.

This requirement was initiated due to internal processes and is not something you need to address if single sign-on is not applicable to your instance of the tool. I apologize for any inconvenience this might have caused, especially as I understand such requests have not been raised in several years and may feel urgent due to cybersecurity considerations.

Thank you for your understanding, and please feel free to let me know if there are any further questions or concerns.

To help stakeholders and business owners better understand the classification of low, medium, and high efforts, here’s a structured framework:

1. Low Effort

Definition: Minimal changes required, involving only the survey team.
Characteristics:
Minor adjustments to survey questions or flow.
No involvement of other teams (e.g., operations, integration, or data provider teams).
Testing and implementation are straightforward and quick.
Examples:
Updating survey language or minor tweaks to trigger conditions.
Continuing with the current approach with minimal or no changes.
2. Medium Effort

Definition: Moderate changes requiring collaboration with one or two additional teams, such as the integration or data provider team.
Characteristics:
Adjustments may involve data alignment, trigger updates, or integration testing.
Requires inputs from either the operations team or data providers.
Testing involves multiple parties but is manageable within a short timeframe.
Examples:
Adding specific conditions to the survey logic for operations-only feedback.
Updating data mapping for more accurate targeting of survey recipients.
3. High Effort

Definition: Significant changes requiring collaboration across multiple teams, including the operations team, integration team, and data provider team.
Characteristics:
Involves redesigning survey flows, changing triggers, or reworking the business model.
Requires approvals, extensive testing, and potential change requests.
Impact on processes is broader and may require substantial time and resources.
Examples:
Overhauling the survey flow to differentiate between operations, line managers, and people leaders.
Redesigning the trigger mechanism to align with the entire business model.
By presenting it this way, stakeholders can quickly evaluate if the proposed changes align with available resources and timelines. You can also include a summary table to visualize the classification:

Effort Level	Teams Involved	Nature of Changes	Example
Low	Survey team only	Minimal adjustments, no complex testing	Tweaking survey language
Medium	Survey + one/two teams	Moderate changes with manageable testing	Updating triggers for operations
High	Multiple teams involved	Significant redesign, extensive testing	Overhauling survey flows



Subject: Meeting Agenda – Data Privacy Considerations for Survey Tools

Agenda Items:

Pilot Survey Using New Supplier Tool

Background: A behavior scientist is conducting a pilot survey with a focus group of 200 colleagues using a survey tool from an existing supplier.
Discussion Points:
Overview of the tool's current usage and licensing (up to 2000 colleagues).
Approval requirements for using the tool as a pilot platform.
Risks and controls to be considered before proceeding.
Future considerations if the tool is to be used extensively across the organization.
Pre-Deployment Survey Using MS Forms

Background: A pre-deployment survey targeting 20-30 colleagues will be conducted by managers using MS Forms instead of the enterprise-licensed platform.
Discussion Points:
Risks associated with using MS Forms for this survey.
Controls and considerations for safely collecting and managing data.
Approval requirements for this alternative survey approach.


Agenda Items:

Pilot Survey Using New Supplier Tool

Background:
The tool was originally onboarded in twenty fifteen or twenty sixteen. A plan to reuse the tool in early twenty twenty-four was delayed.
An addendum to the existing contract has been created to include the SAS module and address data privacy.
A data privacy agreement with the supplier is being finalized with the support of DP Legal.
Discussion Points:
Approval requirements for the pilot survey with a focus group of 200 colleagues.
Risks and controls to consider before proceeding with the tool.
Wording guidance for communication accompanying the invite link to focus group participants.
Ensuring the pseudonymization of data and safe usage of the platform.
Future considerations if the tool is to be used more extensively across the organization.
