If you‚Äôve got more feedback or features to translate into user stories, just keep them coming ‚Äî happy to help write them all up!







You said:
Hi, I want the user stories and I mean not all the points to be included in acceptance criteria. Whatever you have added in the acceptance criteria needs to be into the goal item. So here the supplier has to evaluate each user story so in that case acceptance criteria adding all the user stories may not help me. Can you please break the user stories I have explained so far like exporting different options, extracting into a different format, and identifiable information, what is this, and about the hierarchy filters and then collecting I mean real-time responses functionality to add I mean the field very relevant to it. So all these things need to be added as a different user story. Can you please help with me?


ChatGPT said:
Got it ‚Äî thanks for clarifying! You want each goal or feature separated into its own distinct user story, without crowding the "Acceptance Criteria" section. This will help your supplier evaluate feasibility clearly per requirement.

Here‚Äôs a refined breakdown of the user stories we‚Äôve worked on so far, now split by unique goals:

üß™ Preview and Testing Capabilities
1. Preview Mode for Survey Design
As a survey creator,

I want to preview changes to survey layout across devices (desktop, mobile, tablet),

So that I can ensure a consistent experience before publishing.

2. Real-Time Logic Testing
As a survey creator,

I want a real-time preview that lets me test display logic and branching,

So that I can ensure logic works as expected before making the survey live.

3. Display Logic Validation
As a survey creator,

I want the system to flag any errors in display logic during setup,

So that I can correct them proactively and avoid data issues.

üìÑ Survey Layout and Display
4. Control Question Pagination
As a survey creator,

I want the ability to define how many questions appear per page,

So that I can manage cognitive load for participants.

5. Flexible Display Logic (Same Page vs. Separate Page)
As a survey creator,

I want to control whether follow-up questions appear on the same page or a new page,

So that I can design the survey flow for better user experience.

üìä Dashboard and Reporting
6. Customizable Dashboards
As a report user,

I want to tailor dashboard views based on audience (e.g., HR vs. leadership),

So that each stakeholder sees what is relevant to them.

7. Hierarchy-Based Filtering
As a report user,

I want dashboards to include hierarchy filters (e.g., department, team, manager),

So that users can drill down to relevant results.

8. Exporting Dashboards to Editable Formats
As a report user,

I want to export dashboard visuals into editable PowerPoint or PDF formats,

So that I can reuse charts in business presentations.

9. Selective Data Export
As a report user,

I want to extract filtered data (e.g., only for one team or region),

So that I can run more focused analyses offline.

üîê Data Privacy and Identifiability
10. Identifiable vs. Anonymous Response Control
As a survey admin,

I want to control whether responses are identifiable or anonymous,

So that we can meet privacy requirements for different use cases.

üì• Response Collection Features
11. Real-Time Response Monitoring
As a survey admin,

I want to track response rates and submission counts in real time,

So that I can intervene early if participation is low.

Would you like me to group them under categories in a document, or prepare a table format for sharing with your supplier? Also, feel free to send the next set of features or feedback you want turned into user stories ‚Äî I‚Äôll keep building the list.







You said:
I need the user stories to be break into, as I mentioned, differently, like based on the feedback. The feedback is, can we also ask the control to restrict the duplicate response in SurveyBuild? The feedback for the user story is, the dashboard to display real-time updated data of duplicate submissions, if applicable. But the feedback received is, can we also include the control to restrict the duplicate response in SurveyBuild?


ChatGPT said:
Perfect ‚Äî thanks for that specific example. I now clearly understand that:

You want each feedback point broken into its own user story,

The feedback text should be preserved (so the supplier can trace it back),

The user story should align directly with that feedback,

And no need to cram too much into one story ‚Äî each functionality or capability gets its own.

Let‚Äôs take your example feedback and break it down the way you're asking:

‚úÖ Feedback-Based User Story Breakdown
üß© Feedback 1: ‚ÄúCan we also include the control to restrict the duplicate response in SurveyBuild?‚Äù
User Story Title: Restrict Duplicate Submissions

User Story:
As a survey admin,
I want to have control to prevent duplicate submissions in SurveyBuild,
So that I can ensure each respondent completes the survey only once.

Feedback Source: "Can we also include the control to restrict the duplicate response in SurveyBuild?"

üß© Feedback 2: ‚ÄúDashboard to display real-time updated data of duplicate submissions, if applicable.‚Äù
User Story Title: Display Duplicate Submissions in Dashboard

User Story:
As a dashboard viewer,
I want the dashboard to display real-time data on duplicate survey submissions,
So that I can monitor and manage data integrity during the collection period.

Feedback Source: "Dashboard to display real-time updated data of duplicate submissions, if applicable."

Would you like me to help break down the other feedback you‚Äôve already shared earlier into the same structure? If so, I can go ahead and do that now ‚Äî just confirm if you want the full set done this way.







You said:
The user story is the dashboard to have visualization to track survey participation through response rate. And the feedback is can we have a functionality to compare the response rate over a period of time with the historical data sources.
ChatGPT said:
Great ‚Äî here's how we'll break it down based on your structure:

‚úÖ Feedback-Based User Story Breakdown
üß© Original User Story: Dashboard to have visualization to track survey participation through response rate.
User Story Title: Visualize Survey Response Rate in Dashboard

User Story:
As a dashboard user,
I want to see visualizations that track survey participation via response rate,
So that I can monitor how many people are engaging with the survey in real time.

Feedback Source: "Dashboard to have visualization to track survey participation through response rate."

üß© Feedback: Can we have a functionality to compare the response rate over a period of time with the historical data sources?
User Story Title: Compare Current Response Rate with Historical Data

User Story:
As a dashboard user,
I want to compare the current response rate against historical response data from previous surveys,
So that I can assess trends in participation over time.

Feedback Source: "Can we have a functionality to compare the response rate over a period of time with the historical data sources?"

Let me know the next one you‚Äôd like me to break down, or if you'd like me to loop back to the previous batch and reformat those in this same style.







You said:
The current user story is to create views based on custom filters. And the feedback is, what do you mean by custom view or custom filter? Can you add example outcome? Could you please help me with the custom filter example outcome? Why? Because here the custom filter meant here is, it's more like a visualization tool, custom filter. We have a fixed filters, but we also include other items as well. For example, for the general release, the filters will be kind of region or corporate grid. But when it comes to the custom filter, they can add more filters. My user has the privilege to add more filters. Can you try to bring in using your knowledge?


ChatGPT said:
Absolutely ‚Äî that context helps a lot. You're describing a dashboard feature where users can apply both fixed filters (like region, business unit) and add their own additional filters dynamically ‚Äî this is commonly called ‚Äúself-service filtering‚Äù in visualization tools like Qlik, Tableau, or Qualtrics dashboards.

Let‚Äôs go ahead and structure this into a proper user story with an example outcome that shows what ‚Äúcustom filter‚Äù really means ‚Äî so your supplier has no ambiguity.

‚úÖ Feedback-Based User Story Breakdown
üß© Original User Story: Create views based on custom filters.
User Story Title: Enable Custom Filters for Personalized Dashboard Views

User Story:
As a dashboard user,
I want the ability to apply custom filters beyond the standard ones provided (e.g., region or corporate grid),
So that I can personalize the data view based on additional dimensions relevant to my role.

Example Outcome:
A People Partner in APAC filters the dashboard not only by ‚ÄúRegion = APAC‚Äù (a fixed filter), but also adds a custom filter like ‚ÄúTenure > 2 years‚Äù or ‚ÄúJob Level = 4+‚Äù to view trends specific to experienced employees.

Feedback Source: "What do you mean by custom view or custom filter? Can you add example outcome?"

Let me know if you'd like a second user story to capture the difference between fixed filters (default) and custom filters (user-defined) ‚Äî or if this single story covers it for you. Also happy to rewrite older stories in this exact style if needed.







You said:
The user story is to compare response across surveys for benchmarking, so I can explore tailor-made insights and in-depth analysis according to the business needs. And the feedback is, include one or more item to compare with external benchmarking. And can you please update the user story based on the feedback?
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely! Based on your original user story and the feedback, the request expands the scope to allow comparison not just across internal surveys, but also against external benchmarks ‚Äî this could mean industry standards, external datasets, or vendor-provided benchmarks.

Here‚Äôs how I‚Äôve updated the user story to reflect both:

‚úÖ Feedback-Based User Story Breakdown
üß© Updated User Story: Compare response across surveys for benchmarking, so I can explore tailor-made insights and in-depth analysis according to the business needs.
User Story Title: Benchmark Survey Results Internally and Externally

User Story:
As a dashboard user or analyst,
I want the ability to compare survey responses across multiple internal surveys and with one or more external benchmark datasets,
So that I can tailor insights to business needs and identify whether our results are on par with industry or market standards.

Example Outcome:
A Business HR user can compare engagement scores from this year‚Äôs Employee Experience survey to:

Last year‚Äôs survey (internal benchmark)

The average benchmark for the tech industry provided by an external vendor

Feedback Source: "Include one or more item to compare with external benchmarking."

Let me know if you'd like to isolate the external benchmark comparison as its own story, or if you'd prefer this as a bundled story. I can also help phrase that for technical feasibility discussion if needed!







You said:
The system to integrate the dashboard visualization tool, so I can visualize data effectively. Feedback is, if you can provide examples, that would be great. The next user story is the tool to provide heatmaps to highlight key areas of concern. I can identify and address critical issues. Can we include an outcome or acceptance criteria for this one? The next user story is the tool to provide heatmaps to highlight key areas of high engagement. So I can recognize and leverage areas of high engagement. Can you please add an outcome metric for this one?
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely ‚Äî here‚Äôs how we can enhance each user story you mentioned based on the feedback. I‚Äôve included:

Example outcome for the dashboard integration story.

Outcome or acceptance criteria for the heatmap stories ‚Äî one for areas of concern, and one for areas of high engagement.

üß© User Story 1: Dashboard Integration

I need your help in writing user stories regarding benchmarking. Consider we have benchmarks in Survey Dashboard. When it comes to Survey Dashboard benchmarks, we need to understand what are the external sources aligned to our same organizational or financial benchmarks that we can be included. More details on the report requirements on the Dashboard. I want each item I am saying as a separate user story with a persona relevant to Survey Tool about Dashboard, more details on the Dashboard, report requirements, ability to include benchmarks, and on the SSO side, I need several user stories related to SSO tool to support single sign-on feature and it has to work on multiple browser and the ability to integrate the SSO and also the ability to not allowing the users outside organizations. All these things as a separate user story and with respect to other user stories, I want the ability to send, I mean the ability for a manager to send out a predefined survey. Example, team feedback, speak up, team effectiveness, kind of. Can you please write each user story for the items I have mentioned?


ChatGPT said:
Absolutely ‚Äî here are the user stories you've requested, broken down into individual items with relevant personas. I've grouped them into themes: Benchmarking, Dashboard Reporting, SSO Integration, and Survey Distribution by Managers.
