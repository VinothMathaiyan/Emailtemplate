Subject: Update: Recertified SSO Enabled

Dear Team,

We’re excited to announce that the recertified Single Sign-On (SSO) is now enabled and has been successfully tested internally. This update ensures seamless access to the tool.

If you experience any issues with SSO, please don’t hesitate to reach out. You can escalate or inform us through our group mailbox at [Colleague Listening].
