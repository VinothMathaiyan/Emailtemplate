I hope you're doing well.

I wanted to touch base with you regarding a few observations around task ownership, availability, and communication, particularly in light of what happened yesterday.

Yesterday, I noticed you logged in around 12:30 PM and were intermittently away during the day, with longer periods of inactivity. I had reassigned two other tasks to ensure you had enough focus time to complete the task I assigned to you. As we had previously discussed, I was expecting a status update by the end of the day, but unfortunately, I didn’t receive any update or communication regarding the progress. You had logged off earlier than expected, and there was no visibility on the task status.

This isn't isolated to just yesterday. I’ve been noticing a recurring pattern where the login time starts post-11 AM and ends before 6 PM, often with multiple extended breaks in between. While I understand flexibility is sometimes needed, the effective working hours are averaging around 3–4 hours a day, and this is starting to impact deliverables and overall team coordination.

Additionally, I’ve noticed delays in task completion, reduced attention to detail, and a lack of proactive communication. These aspects are critical—especially for someone with your experience level—when it comes to driving accountability and ensuring smooth collaboration within the team.

My intention here is not to be critical but to share these observations so we can work together on a more consistent and transparent approach going forward. I’d appreciate it if you could:

Keep me informed of your availability and log-off times, especially when you're assigned a priority task.

Share timely status updates, even if the task isn’t completed.

Reach out proactively if you’re facing challenges or require clarifications.

Let’s connect if you’d like to discuss this further—I’m happy to support you where needed

please share stepwise advice
Stepwise Advice for Building Your C4 C1 (Context) and C2 (Container) Diagrams
Step 1: Clarify the Scope and Purpose
Clearly define your main system: e.g., "Qualtrics Employee Experience and Listening Program".

Write a brief description of what this system achieves for your organization.

List the main goals of diagramming these levels (e.g., to communicate with stakeholders, map data flow, or guide integration).

Step 2: Identify Key Personas and External Systems (Context Level)
List all user personas: HR business partners, managers, journey owners, pod leads, HR experts, employees, analytics leads, brand admins.

List all external systems interacting with your main system: Workday HRDP, ServiceNow UEL, SFTP connectors, Qlik Sense, Celonis.

For each, write one line detailing their purpose/interaction with the system.

Step 3: Draw the Level 1 (Context) Diagram
Place your central system (Qualtrics EX Platform) in the middle.

Place personas (yellow) and external systems (green) around it.

Draw arrows indicating direction and purpose of each interaction:

Data input flows (e.g., HRDP → Qualtrics)

User actions (e.g., HR business partners → Qualtrics: "design surveys")

Use recommended C4 colors (yellow for people, blue for central system, green for externals).

Step 4: Break Down Major Internal Containers (Container Level)
List the internal "big building blocks" inside Qualtrics:

Survey Module (design and distribution)

Data Processing & ETL (clean/transform source data)

Employee/Contact Directory (targeting)

Analytics/Dashboard Module (reporting)

SFTP/API Connectors (secure data import infrastructure)

Customer Experience Platform (optional, for customer surveys)

Qlik/Celonis Export Module (for future exports)

Briefly describe the role/function of each.

Step 5: Draw the Level 2 (Container) Diagram
Place the main system at the center with internal containers (blue) inside it.

Position external systems (green) and connectors (gray) outside the boundary.

Draw directional arrows showing how data moves:

From external sources into SFTP/API connectors

From connectors to Data Processing

From Data Processing to Directory and Survey Module

Survey responses to Analytics/Dashboard Module

Outputs to Qlik/Celonis

Ensure alignment with C4 notation and color code.

Step 6: Describe Data and User Flows in Both Levels
Summarize for each diagram how information and control flow.

For C1: Who triggers actions, who receives surveys/reports, where data goes in/out.

For C2: Detail sequence—source data → processing → storage/targeting → survey → analytics/dashboard → output.

Step 7: Review for Completeness and Accuracy
Confirm all personas, systems, and containers are included as discussed.

Ensure all key flows are unambiguous.

Consider reviewing with a stakeholder or domain expert for validation.

You may use tools like draw.io, Lucidchart, or Structurizr to translate these steps into actual diagrams, using the color codes and conventions specified. This will ensure your C4 diagrams are both clear and aligned with industry standards
