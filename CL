1. YourView Survey:
Successfully organized and led the YourView Survey project, creating a comprehensive checklist to ensure thorough analysis. Took the initiative to develop and manage a checklist in Jira, incorporating automation for detailed checks to guarantee the accuracy of participant data. Collaborated effectively with Jon to obtain precise headcount data, and coordinated with the UX and Data Sourcing teams to streamline and enhance the survey process. These efforts resulted in an improved and efficient workflow for the survey execution.

2. Post Pivot Activities:
2a. Surveys
Rebuilt all surveys efficiently to ensure all field changes were properly incorporated. Implemented accessibility features in collaboration with Praveen and Nikits, while also taking steps to educate the team on how to manage these changes independently in the future. Despite a busy period, I ensured all documentation was meticulously completed and updated in both Jira and Confluence for future reference.

2b. Automation and Field Changes
Ensured that the LB/Active files were correctly updated with the new field changes by regularly coordinating with the HRDP team. Thorough documentation was maintained in Confluence to support future reference and ease of transition.
Given that the Active file contains over 100,000 records, I developed a Python automation tool to validate the data efficiently each time the file was updated. Additionally, collaborated with other team members on automation initiatives, providing support and delivering faster outputs through streamlined processes. 


3. Gen AI Hackathon Participation
Contributed to the Gen AI Hackathon, focusing on enhancing colleague experience through AI-driven solutions for streamlining the survey preparation process.
Explored the use of Generative AI in collaboration with Data scientists, stakeholders, to optimize surveys.


4. HR ExperienceSurvey
The HX Survey was one of the most complex projects, presenting challenges such as randomization, a dynamic progress bar, and a large volume of questions. I took the lead in developing these questions, exploring various approaches to ensure optimal functionality. Additionally, I made sure that Praveen was fully trained on the setup, enabling him to manage it independently moving forward.

The next critical task was building eight different dashboards. Each dashboard initially took over 20 hours to create. However, by working on a solution to merge all eight into a single comprehensive dashboard, I was able to reduce the effort by 75%, significantly improving efficiency and time management.

5. Supporting Sobers with Workday Survey Dashboard
Collaborated with Sobers to create a comprehensive dashboard for the Workday survey within a tight two-day deadline. In addition, we implemented TextiQ for analyzing open-text responses. Worked effectively with various teams to generate relevant topics and keywords, ensuring the dashboard provided actionable insights for stakeholders.

6. Mandatory Training detailed Test Cases
Automated the process of generating 27 CSV files for test cases by implementing a solution that dynamically adjusted values and created separate files for each test case.
Successfully improved efficiency by automating the manual task of changing scenario values and generating corresponding output files.

7. Collaboration on Recruitment Shortlisting
Assisted in the recruitment process by helping to shortlist candidates, streamlining the evaluation process for key roles.
