Thank you for your detailed analysis and for highlighting the concern around bias in the topic composition—particularly the presence of negative terms such as "no" or "not," which could potentially skew interpretation.

We acknowledge and agree that some of the keywords we initially provided may have introduced this bias, and we will revisit the list to refine and remove any negatively framed or misleading terms to improve the quality and objectivity of the analysis.

That said, we would like to emphasize that there are a few important themes that seem to be missing from the current output, and we believe it’s worth reviewing them again—especially with regard to their coverage and relevance before and after Workday implementation. We are happy to support this by:

Reassessing and enriching the keyword list with more neutral and representative terms

Mapping them to the Ngram outputs to validate theme presence and prevalence

Would it also be possible for your team to explore regenerating the topics based on the cleaned-up keyword list, or suggest an alternate approach to uncover themes that may have been missed due to the initial bias?

We understand and respect the rationale for flagging these themes as TBR (To Be Reviewed), but we believe a second look—guided by a more refined keyword set—might help us better capture the lived experiences of new joiners and hiring managers.

Appreciate your continued support on this. Please let us know if you need anything further from our end.
