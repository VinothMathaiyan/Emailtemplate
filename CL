Will the scope of the change create new, amend, or remove existing data for the process?
✅ Yes
Notes:
The Qualtrics platform captures new survey response data from colleagues, primarily related to employee experience. This includes new free-text and structured feedback across onboarding, exit, and HR service touchpoints. However, it does not amend or delete core system-of-record data in HR platforms.

2. Will the scope of the change consume new data that was not used before this change or change the source of data consumption?
✅ Yes
Notes:
Operational data from systems like Workday, ServiceNow, and HRDP is now being integrated into Qualtrics for survey distribution logic, segmentation, and reporting. This includes metadata such as employee role, department, and lifecycle event timestamps.

3. Will the scope of the change remove a business application (ITBA) from production or the process?
❌ No
Notes:
No existing business applications are being decommissioned or removed. Qualtrics is being introduced as an additional experience management platform to complement current systems.

4. Will the scope of the change introduce a new business application (ITBA) that was not used in the process previously?
✅ Yes
Notes:
Qualtrics is a new third-party SaaS tool being introduced and integrated for survey-based employee experience insights. It was not previously part of the official process landscape managed under LCT.

5. Does the scope of development include new or changes to management of relevant records within the applications being created or modified?
✅ Yes (Minimal)
Notes:
While Qualtrics manages survey records, this pertains mainly to survey responses and metadata. There is no development of new communication tools or custom record management systems within this initiative. Responses are retained for reporting and audit purposes under platform policies.

6. Might the change involve data being held externally or transmitted to third parties?
✅ Yes
Notes:
Qualtrics is a cloud-based SaaS platform, and therefore employee feedback data is stored and processed externally in accordance with contractual agreements and security frameworks. Only necessary data is transmitted, and access is limited to authorized users.

7. Might the change entail using, storing, or accessing information capable of identifying an individual data subject?
✅ Yes
Notes:
The survey platform may store personally identifiable information (PII) such as employee name, email, and organizational metadata, especially for targeted lifecycle surveys. However, responses can also be anonymized based on survey design. Data handling complies with data privacy and GDPR standards.

8. Might the solution require new operational technology locations to be operational (e.g., facilities or staff in new locations)?
❌ No
Notes:
There is no new physical infrastructure, facility setup, or regional expansion associated with this tool implementation. All operations remain within existing global HR technology support frameworks.

9. Could any third parties be involved in the development, delivery, or support of the solution?
✅ Yes
Notes:
Yes. The Qualtrics Engineering Team supports implementation, integration, and configuration activities. No development or custom coding is performed internally. Internal stakeholders manage content and workflow configurations with vendor support.

10. Will your product, business outcome, feature delivery create or change a user interface or digital documentation (e.g., PDF)?
✅ Yes
Notes:
Survey templates and dashboards are created using Qualtrics’ UI builder. These changes are drag-and-drop configurations with no code. PDFs may be generated for reporting purposes from dashboards.

11. Will your UI changes be classified as a small change (e.g., edits to existing copy, adding data elements to an existing table or forms, or impact less than 300 users)?
✅ Yes
Notes:
Yes, changes such as editing question copy or dashboard filters are considered small changes. They are non-code, impact limited audiences, and are fully configurable via platform UI.

12. Might the solution be used by consumers, clients, prospects, members of the public, or other external stakeholders? (i.e., not just colleagues)
❌ No
Notes:
The Qualtrics survey solution is used internally only, for active and former colleagues, HR teams, and managers. No public-facing surveys or external audiences are included in this scope.

13. Does the scope of this work include adoption of or migration to any AWS, Salesforce, APN, or other external cloud?
✅ Yes (SaaS hosted)
Notes:
Yes, Qualtrics is hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) as its backend infrastructure. However, this is managed fully by the vendor. There is no internal cloud development or migration initiative as part of this project.


Does the scope of this product or any enhancement to this product involve the development, deployment, or adoption of any human productivity tracking capabilities?
❌ No
Notes:
Qualtrics is used exclusively for employee feedback collection via surveys. It does not track productivity, performance, or behavioral analytics like screen time or task completion rates.

2. If the answer is yes, then please confirm if agreement has been obtained from the data usage working group and provide details of the agreement.
➡️ Not applicable
Because there is no human productivity tracking involved.

3. Does this BO introduce or make changes to the access model for the application being changed? Includes any interface requiring identification, authentication, or authorization of users or systems?
✅ Yes (minimal)
Notes:
Qualtrics uses existing SSO/SAML-based authentication via our organization’s Identity Access Management (IAM). There is no custom authentication method. Access management is governed by existing provisioning processes. This is not a new access model, but aligns with internal standards.

4. Does this BO have an impact on controls protecting data at rest or in transit or in use?
✅ Yes (standard controls)
Notes:
Survey response data is protected using Qualtrics’ in-built encryption for both data at rest and in transit. No live production data is used in non-prod/test environments. PII is only collected where required, and data masking or pseudonymization is applied where appropriate. The tool operates within standard data privacy frameworks.

5. Does this BO have an impact to existing or introduce new network architecture?
❌ No
Notes:
Qualtrics is a cloud-based SaaS platform. No internal network changes, firewall modifications, or architecture redesigns are involved.

6. Does this BO impact an existing application or the development of a new application? Includes existing or new code, API calls, or connections.
✅ Yes (integration only)
Notes:
There is no custom application development or code deployment. However, Qualtrics is integrated with ServiceNow and other internal systems using pre-configured API connectors (e.g., for lifecycle survey triggers). No internal codebase is changed.

7. Does this BO require the onboarding of a new third-party service or change the scope of an existing third-party service? Includes configuration or features of existing cloud environment.
✅ Yes
Notes:
Qualtrics is a new third-party SaaS product being onboarded into the LCT. It does not require hosting in our environment but does involve configuration changes (e.g., enabling connectors, user roles, dashboard design). No change to cloud infrastructure setup.

8. Does this BO create a new or impact an existing baseline build configuration (e.g., secure config docs, servers, containers, deviations from patterns)?
❌ No
Notes:
There is no baseline build configuration impacted. Qualtrics is a pre-built SaaS platform. No containers, VMs, or custom deployments are part of this implementation.

9. Does this BO have an impact on the logging and monitoring solution used by the application product or change the security monitoring needs?
✅ Yes (minimal, handled by vendor)
Notes:
Qualtrics includes its own logging, audit trails, and monitoring mechanisms. No new internal SIEM configurations are introduced. However, regular platform usage reports can be exported if required.

10. Does this BO introduce a new cryptography or impact existing cryptography solutions and controls?
❌ No
Notes:
Qualtrics uses native encryption (AES 256-bit) managed by the vendor. There is no change to internal cryptographic systems or policies.

11. Are you making an architectural change, adopting new technology, or using a new technology supplier?
✅ Yes (new supplier)
Notes:
Yes, Qualtrics is a new technology supplier for colleague listening and experience surveys. However, this is SaaS-based with minimal architectural dependency.

12. Is this change creating a new IT service offering or IT service production instance in the ServiceNow configuration management database (CMDB)?
✅ Yes
Notes:
Qualtrics will be registered as a new IT service in CMDB as part of the product onboarding and compliance requirement under Lean Control. This includes configuration and service categorization.
