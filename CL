Current-State Access Management Process

1. Dashboard Access Management (via HR Hub)

Process Steps:

The requester navigates to the HR Hub portal.

Selects the tab labeled "Colleague Surveys & Dashboard Access".

Fills out a common request form, which includes:

Dashboard name (entered manually)

Approver name (entered manually)

Business justification

The request is submitted and enters a shared queue that includes both Reporting and Colleague Listening team requests.

The Reporting team reviews the request and, if it pertains to Colleague Listening, reassigns it accordingly.

The Colleague Listening (CL) team receives the reassigned ticket and:

Checks the dashboard name. If unclear, they follow up with the requester.

Verifies the approver. If incorrect, they contact the correct approver for confirmation.

Once the dashboard name and approver details are confirmed, the CL team provisions dashboard access.

Current Challenges:

No dedicated queue for Colleague Listening in the portal.

Dashboard name and approver are entered in free text, which leads to confusion and delays.

2. User Access Management for Qualtrics Tool (via MyIT)

Process Steps:

Requester raises a MyIT request to access the Qualtrics tool.

The CL team reviews the business justification.

Upon validation, the CL team provisions access in Qualtrics.

JML Limitation:

There is no Joiner-Mover-Leaver (JML) integration with the Qualtrics tool.

The system is not connected to HR lifecycle systems, so access is not automatically updated based on employment status changes.

Mitigation Measures:

The Tech team monitors for mover/leaver events manually.

If an employee is identified as a mover or leaver, the Tech team raises a ticket.

The CL team receives the ticket and revokes access manually in Qualtrics.

Additionally, the CL team conducts periodic checks with the Talent team to validate whether existing user access is still relevant and should be retained.

Summary of Risk Mitigation for Mover/Leaver Events:

Although JML integration is missing, the risk is managed through:

Manual detection by Tech team.

Ticket-based revocation process.

Periodic manual audits involving the Talent team.

This dual-layered process ensures that unauthorized access is reduced even without an automated JML system.
