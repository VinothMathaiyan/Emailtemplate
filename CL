Certainly! Here are some examples and use cases for each option, along with considerations for a proof of concept (PoC):

Option 1: Continue as-is

Use Case: The HR Ops team can manually filter out irrelevant services from their reports.

PoC Need: Low. This option relies on current processes. However, a PoC could help determine the impact of excluding services and how it affects CSAT scores.


Option 2: Use "Assignment Group" variable

Use Case: Automatically categorize cases based on the assignment group, triggering different survey flows for HR Ops and People Leaders.

PoC Need: Medium. A PoC can validate the reliability of the "Assignment Group" variable and ensure it effectively distinguishes between HR Ops and People Leader involvement.


Option 3: Adjust survey questions based on involvement

Use Case: Tailor survey questions dynamically based on who managed the case, providing more relevant feedback.

PoC Need: High. A PoC would be beneficial to test the effectiveness of question variations and ensure they yield meaningful responses.


Option 4: Skip survey for cases handled by People Leaders

Use Case: Implement a rule to bypass the survey trigger for specific cases, focusing feedback on HR Ops-managed cases.

PoC Need: Medium. A PoC can assess the impact of skipping surveys on overall feedback and satisfaction metrics.


In each case, a PoC can help identify potential challenges early and refine the solution before full implementation. Let me know if you need more details on any specific use case!


Certainly! Here’s a breakdown of the RAIDs for each option:

Option 1: Continue as-is

Risks: HR Ops team might struggle with incomplete data if they exclude certain services.

Assumptions: HR Ops can accurately identify and exclude non-relevant services.

Issues: Potential for confusion and misinterpretation of data.

Dependencies: Accurate classification of services in dashboards.


Option 2: Use "Assignment Group" variable

Risks: Misclassification if "Assignment Group" is not consistently used.

Assumptions: The "Assignment Group" reliably indicates the responsible team.

Issues: Potential complexity in maintaining and updating the variable.

Dependencies: Proper integration and use of "Assignment Group" in both systems.


Option 3: Adjust survey questions based on involvement

Risks: Survey fatigue if too many variations are introduced.

Assumptions: Colleagues can provide meaningful feedback based on tailored questions.

Issues: Increased complexity in survey design.

Dependencies: Accurate identification of involvement to adjust questions accordingly.


Option 4: Skip survey for cases handled by People Leaders

Risks: Missed feedback opportunities if cases handled by People Leaders aren't surveyed.

Assumptions: Cases handled by People Leaders are less relevant to HR Ops' CSAT.

Issues: Potentially incomplete understanding of overall colleague satisfaction.

Dependencies: Accurate distinction between People Leader and HR Ops cases.


This should give you a clear overview to help guide your decision-making process!

Certainly! Here’s a summary of the problem and approach:

Problem Statement: The HR Ops team is facing challenges with their Colleague Satisfaction (CSAT) scores. When HR cases are closed in ServiceNow, a feedback survey is triggered in Qualtrics. However, some cases are heavily managed by the People Leader team instead of HR Ops, leading to dissatisfaction being attributed to HR Ops. This impacts their CSAT scores and doesn't allow them to take actionable insights.

Approach to Address the Gap:

1. Option 1: Continue as-is, but the HR Ops team will exclude specific services from their dashboard.


2. Option 2: Use the "Assignment Group" variable to differentiate if the case is handled by HR Ops or People Leader. Tailor the survey flow accordingly.


3. Option 3: Adjust survey questions based on who is involved (HR Ops or People Leader).


4. Option 4: Skip the survey for cases handled predominantly by People Leaders to avoid impacting HR Ops' CSAT scores.



High-Level Data Flow:

1. Case Closure in ServiceNow: Triggers an event.


2. Integration: Between ServiceNow and Qualtrics.


3. Survey Triggered in Qualtrics: Sends an email and creates a task in ServiceNow.


4. Response Collection: Survey responses are collected and analyzed.
