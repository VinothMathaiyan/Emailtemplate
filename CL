Hi [Name/Team],

As discussed earlier and based on the agreed responsibilities, the preparation of the full RFI — including the scoring section, vision, objectives, and all required details — sits with the tech team to ensure it aligns with our standards, governance, and completeness before it is shared with the client.

From our side, we have already provided the required inputs, including:

Detailed business requirements (link shared by Paul in SharePoint)

VivaGlenn team’s responses

Initial draft version of the RFI

Could you please confirm if you have everything needed from our side to complete the document? If there are any additional details or clarifications required, we are happy to support.

Once the file is ready, please share it so we can proceed with circulation to the client as planned. Given the timeline, an update at the earliest would help ensure we remain on track.
