Subject: Issues with UEL (ServiceNow) and Qualtrics Integration – Token Expiry and Environment Upgrade Challenges

Hi [Recipient's Name],

I hope you're doing well.

I’m reaching out to highlight two critical issues we’ve been encountering with the integration between Qualtrics and UEL (our ServiceNow instance), which we use to trigger HR case closure surveys. Below is the context and detailed breakdown of the problems we are facing:

Background
We have a live integration between Qualtrics and ServiceNow that automatically triggers a survey upon the closure of an HR case in ServiceNow. This allows us to collect timely feedback on colleague experiences with the service provided.

Issue 1: OAuth Token Expiry – Impacting Task Creation
Problem: We have observed a recurring pattern where the integration fails to create a task in ServiceNow every ~100 days. This issue was first noticed in November, then again in February, and most recently last week.

Root Cause Identified: The ServiceNow team investigated and confirmed that the Qualtrics refresh token is configured with a 100-day expiry. Once expired, the token is no longer valid, which leads to failures in task creation in ServiceNow.

Impact: As the task isn’t created, the Qualtrics survey isn't nudged, resulting in a drop in survey response rates.

Assumptions and Gaps:

The ServiceNow team initially assumed that Qualtrics would handle token auto-refresh dynamically, but this is currently not in place.

The Qualtrics Engineering team has requested endpoint and configuration details and is now evaluating the possibility of enabling dynamic token refresh.

Temporary Workaround Proposed by ServiceNow:

Extend the token expiry duration to 200 or even 365 days.

However, this still requires manual intervention to refresh credentials before expiry and is not scalable or sustainable.

Our Ask: We request the Qualtrics Engineering team to explore and confirm if a dynamic refresh token mechanism can be implemented on your side, so this issue can be resolved permanently and the integration can be made robust.

Issue 2: Instance Connectivity Post-ServiceNow Upgrade
Background: ServiceNow undergoes regular upgrades (e.g., Vancouver, Washington DC, Utah, San Diego, and now Yokohama), typically every 4 months.

Testing Process: We use various ServiceNow environments (UAT, DEV, TEST, RTP) to validate upgrade compatibility before deploying changes to Production.

Problem Observed: After each upgrade, when we attempt to test the integration in non-production instances:

The connection between Qualtrics and ServiceNow fails.

Errors such as "connection disabled" or "invalid account" appear.

Troubleshooting Steps Tried:

Refreshing credentials using the existing setup.

Re-authenticating the same account — often still results in errors.

Workaround: The only successful method has been to:

Create an entirely new account in Qualtrics.

Rebuild the entire workflow and mapping from scratch, which is time-consuming and inefficient.

Our Ask: We would appreciate it if the Qualtrics Engineering team could:

Investigate why the integration disconnects after ServiceNow upgrades.

Clarify whether this is related to ServiceNow’s upgrade process, token/credential handling in Qualtrics, or something else.

Propose a sustainable fix to avoid this repeated manual rework for every upgrade cycle.

We’d be grateful for your inputs and proposed next steps on both issues. Please let us know if further details or logs are required from our side to assist with the investigation.

Looking forward to your response and support in resolving these integration concerns.
