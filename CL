We wanted to provide some additional clarification regarding our requirement for the onboarding survey analysis, to ensure we are aligned and avoid any potential rework.

Context:
We are running two surveys as part of the onboarding feedback initiative:

Candidate Survey (New Joiner Experience)

Hiring Manager Survey (Recruitment Experience)

Each survey is structured around 7–8 key stages of the hiring/onboarding journey. For example:

Hiring Manager Survey Stages: Requirement gathering, application approval, interview process, candidate selection, offer release, logistics, onboarding day, etc.

Candidate Survey Stages: Job application, communication, interview experience, offer release, offer acceptance, joining day, onboarding app usage, and the first-week experience.

Each stage includes:

A rating question

A corresponding open-ended question

Given this structure, we are receiving a high volume of qualitative responses.

Our Ask:
Our key requirement is to extract meaningful themes and sub-topics from the open-ended responses at each stage—not just surface-level keywords. Specifically, we are looking for:

Sub-Themes/Topics:

For each stage, what are the emerging topics discussed by respondents?

Are the responses about a problem, challenge, positive experience, or an area of improvement?

Example:
For the "Interview" stage, possible sub-themes could be:

Lack of panel availability

Unclear communication

Delay in feedback

Positive panel behavior

Contextual Clarity Beyond Keywords:
While keyword tagging is helpful, on its own it does not provide sufficient insight. We need a more context-aware grouping of responses to derive actionable insights. Ideally:

The analysis should cluster responses under relevant themes or sentiments (e.g., delays, clarity, fairness, friendliness).

If possible, link representative comments to each theme for illustration.

Keyword Combination/Collocation Analysis:
Please go beyond individual word tagging. We are also interested in:

Combination of terms or phrases that frequently occur together and convey a specific meaning.

Identifying if certain words are consistently mentioned together (e.g., "panel delay," "logistics confusion," "smooth onboarding app").

This will help us understand not just what is being mentioned, but also how it is being expressed contextually.

Summary of Needs:
Requirement	Details
Thematic Grouping	Identify meaningful sub-themes from open-end responses per stage
Sentiment/Context Tagging	Classify responses into areas like challenge, improvement, positive
Beyond Keywords	Avoid only listing keywords; focus on interpretation and grouping
Phrase-Level Insights	Surface recurring meaningful phrases or combinations of keywords

We appreciate your effort and would love to work together closely on this. Please let us know if a quick sync is needed to walk through our expectations in more detail.

Looking forward to your support.
