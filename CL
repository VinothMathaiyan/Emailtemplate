Level 1 (System Context – C1)
Goal:
Show the big picture: key systems, personas, and high-level data flows.

Visual:
Draw six boxes:

HR System (People Insights / Minerva / HRDP)

Workday (learning module)

ServiceNow (case/ticket system)

Qualtrics EX (Employee Experience)

Qualtrics CX (Customer Experience)

Dashboards (BI portal for HR managers, analysts, data scientists)

Add personas:

Colleague (survey respondent)

Qualtrics Admin (builds surveys and workflows)

HR Business Manager / Analyst (consumes dashboards)

Arrows:

HRDP → Qualtrics EX

Workday → Qualtrics EX

ServiceNow → Qualtrics CX

Qualtrics EX/CX → Dashboards

Colleague → Qualtrics → (response flows)

Admin → Qualtrics EX/CX

Annotate:

Indicate SFTP (sftp.fra1.qualtrics.com, port 22, 00:30 every day)

JSON/API triggers, Qualtrics‑ServiceNow connector




-------

Level 2 (Containers – C2)
Focus on each system and its internal containers, plus integrations.

System: Qualtrics EX & CX Platform
Container: Qualtrics ETL Workflow Engine
Type: SaaS-managed container
Tech: Qualtrics ETL, Web Service API, SFTP Task

Container: Survey Engine + Workflows
Tech: Survey Flow, JSON Event trigger, ServiceNow task

Container: Dashboard & Reporting (Qualtrics-built dashboards or external BI export)

System: HRDP / Minerva
Container: Minerva Hierarchy + Employee & Recruitment Files (SFTP drop)
Type: Batch files (CSV) delivered via SFTP (ftp.fra1.qualtrics.com port 22)

System: Workday
Container: Integration Services
Tech: Workday Integration Services, SFTP file delivery, Business Object APIs
Container: Learning Data Files (CSV dropped to SFTP)

System: ServiceNow
Container: ServiceNow HRSD / Case Mgmt platform
Container: Qualtrics Spoke (Integration Hub)
Tech: OAuth-based connector, JSON Event-based integration


Arrows between containers:
From HRDP SFTP → Qualtrics ETL Workflow Engine (via SFTP extraction)
From Workday Integration Services → SFTP → Qualtrics ETL
From ServiceNow Case Mgmt → Qualtrics Survey Engine (via Qualtrics Spoke JSON event trigger)
From Survey Engine → ServiceNow (via ServiceNow task action)
From Survey Engine → Dashboard & Reporting container
Personas: Admin → Survey Engine; Colleague → Survey Engine; Dashboard consumers ← Dashboard container

---------------------------------------

Level 3 (Components – C3)
Drill into each container’s major sub‑components or processes.

Qualtrics ETL Workflow Engine
	Component: SFTP Extract Task
		Implements: SSH key or password authentication, reads files prefixed e.g. “minerva_*.csv”

Component: Data Loader / Directory Task
	Maps files into XM Directory, applies data massaging/derived fields

Component: Workflow Scheduler (00:30 daily pipeline runner)



Qualtrics Survey Engine + Workflows
Component: Survey Flow (friendly branching, embedded data)
Component: JSON Event Listener (ServiceNow case closure triggers a survey)
Component: Response-redirect Tasks (create/update ServiceNow cases via ServiceNow task action)
Component: Dashboard Export (writes results, pushes to dashboard container)

Workday Integration Services
Component: Learning Data Export job (recurring daily)
Component: File generation & drop to SFTP server

HRDP / Minerva stack
Component: Data extraction from People Insight (Minerva)
Component: File creation – Active employee, recruitment
Component: Drop to SFTP

ServiceNow
Component: Case Table (cases, closures)
Component: Event Publisher (when case status changes to closed)
Component: Qualtrics Spoke OAuth-client registration
Component: JSON payload dispatch to Qualtrics EX/CX

Arrows annotations: include data schema types, triggers:
	E.g. “active_employee.csv → SFTP → Qualtrics ETL (CSV import)”
	“Workday_learning.csv → CSV prefix learning_…”
		“ServiceNow case_closed JSON → Qualtrics JSON Event (payload includes caseID, resolver, satisfaction)”		
	“Survey response → ServiceNow task create incident (if negative CSAT)”
	“Derived embedded data → branch logic → dashboard data export.”


-------------------------

Level 4 (Code / C4)
Zoom into specific tasks, fields, endpoints.

Example: SFTP Extract Task
	Name: Minerva Active Employee Import
	Description: SSH‑key authentication to sftp.fra1.qualtrics.com:22, picks prefix active_*, loads into XM Directory
	Technology: Qualtrics ETL “Extract data from SFTP files” task (port 22, key or password auth)
	T	ype: File Extractor

Example: Workday Learning Export
	Name: Workday Learning Export Job
	Description: Workday Integration Service scheduled extract of learning records, drops file learning_yyyyMMdd.csv to SFTP

Example: JSON Event Listener
	Name: CaseClosedJSON
	Description: Qualtrics Workflow action “Started when event is received”, event type=ServiceNow case_closed with JSON schema
	Tech: Qualtrics JSON Event in Survey Workflow


Example: ServiceNow Task Action
	Name: CreateIncidentIfNegative
	Description: Within Qualtrics Workflow: condition (embedded CSAT <3), task = "Create new record" on ServiceNow incident table via Qualtrics extension
	Tech: Qualtrics ServiceNow Task (OAuth integration)


Arrows for C4:
Label with specific file names/prefixes, field mappings (e.g. employeeID, department, learning_hours).
Label JSON event payload examples: { "case_id": ..., "status":"closed", "resolution_time":..., "colleague_id":...}.
Dashboard export: file or API push with responseID, embedded data fields, responses.

✅ Summary Guidance
Once you build Confluence:

C1 – draw big boxes & personas with high‑level arrows and annotation like “daily SFTP”, “JSON trigger”.

C2 – zoom into each system, show containers and inter‑container arrows.

C3 – inside each container draw main component boxes (extract, scheduler, flow engine, event handler).

C4 – zoom into a single component (e.g. SFTP Extract Task), list name, description, tech, type, protocols, file names, JSON schema, arrow labels.

Label everything with C4-style metadata (name, description, technology, type).
Use consistent icons or colors for personas, systems, containers, components, code-level elements.
Annotate arrow directions, triggers (schedule, event).
In text explanation, tie each arrow label to what data & field maps happen.
