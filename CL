I'm working with a Qualtrics survey and I have a text field where I trigger an alert if the user exceeds 300 characters. The alert message is 'Alert: You have reached the maximum character length of 300.' However, when using screen readers like NVDA, the word 'alert' is being read out twice before the actual message. I have two files involved: one is a jQuery file and the other is the alert-info text. Could you help me identify possible reasons for this duplication and suggest a way to fix it so that the alert message is only read once by screen readers?
