Step-by-Step Plan to Prepare the RFP
1. Establish the Core Objectives of the RFP
Start by clearly defining the intent:

Evaluate and select a new Employee Experience survey platform before December 2026.

Ensure the new platform supports all current use cases: engagement, lifecycle, 360, pulses, etc.

Ensure integrations (Workday, HR case tools, LMS, etc.) are maintained or improved.

Ensure smooth data migration and minimal disruption.

2. Create a Cross-Functional Working Group
Include stakeholders from:

Colleague Listening / People Analytics

HR Tech / Systems

Data Privacy & Security

IT (Integrations)

Procurement / Vendor Management

Legal & Compliance

Business stakeholders (e.g., HRBPs, Talent Management)

3. Define and Structure the RFP Document

5. Data Migration Requirements
This is critical. Vendors should respond to:

Migration of historical data (2018â€“2026)

Format and volume of existing data

Migration of metadata: project setup, survey logic, dashboards, translations

File format compatibility

Timeline for migration

Validation and sign-off approach

Historical benchmarking continuity

Security of data during migration

Cost of migration (if any)

Example Data Assets to Migrate:

Response data

Dashboards

Metadata (survey structure, roles, workflows)

Embedded data (e.g., org data, demographics)

Text responses with themes (especially if using Text iQ/NLP)

6. Implementation Timeline
Ask the vendor to provide:

Project plan with key milestones

Expected implementation duration

UAT and parallel run plan

Data migration timeline

Training & change management

7. Evaluation Criteria
Let vendors know how you will score:

Fit to functional requirements

Integration capability

UX for respondents and admins

Data security and compliance

Cost (TCO: licensing, support, migration)

Vendor experience in EX space

Implementation & support model

8. Submission Instructions
Format: Word/PDF + Excel for requirement matrix

Deadline for questions

Proposal submission deadline

Contact person

ðŸ“¦ Attachments You Should Include
Requirement checklist (Excel format with Must-have / Nice-to-have)

Sample survey types (e.g., screenshots or descriptions)

Volume stats (approximate responses per year)

Data structure examples (e.g., fields used, embedded data examples)

Integration flow diagrams (e.g., Workday to Qualtrics)

ðŸ§  Tips for Creating the RFP
Be vendor-agnostic: Donâ€™t tailor it to Qualtrics or Glint.

Prioritize your must-have and nice-to-have requirements.

Make sure legal and infosec reviews are baked in before release.

Create a scorecard in Excel for the evaluation team.

Plan for vendor demos and use case-based walkthroughs.
