Subject: Action Required: Review of Survey Questionnaire & Timeline Confirmation

Dear [Stakeholder's Name],

I hope you're doing well. As we prepare for our upcoming survey, I'm reattaching the draft survey questionnaire we used last time, along with a link for you to test it. Could you please review and provide your feedback? We'd like to finalize this in the first week of February.

Following this, we'll proceed with the timeline as discussed:

Survey Build: Complete by February 17th

Survey Testing: Finish by February 23rd

Survey Open Date: March 3rd, for three weeks

Survey Closing Date: [insert date]

Reminder Dates: Scheduled during the survey period

Your input is invaluable, and we appreciate your prompt response to help us stay on track.
