üìò Title: Enhancing Governance and Control Measures in Qualtrics Survey Tool
üî∂ Executive Summary
Qualtrics plays a central role in how we gather, analyze, and act upon colleague feedback.

However, current governance and compliance controls are insufficient in meeting internal risk standards and audit readiness.

This presentation outlines our key risk areas, existing gaps, and recommendations for control improvements.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Governance Pillars to Be Strengthened
We have identified four main control areas:

Control Area	Risk Category	Current Gaps	Desired State
User Access Management	Operational / Compliance	Manual granting/revoking access. No automated integration with HR joiner-mover-leaver data.	Automated role-based access aligned to employment status.
Dashboard Access Management	Operational / Compliance	Ad hoc requests handled manually; risk of over-provisioning.	Rule-based access provisioning with periodic reviews.
Content Management / Export Tracking	Data Governance / Security	No logging/tracking of export events or ownership.	Audit trail on who exports what and when.
Data Privacy Consent Tracking	Regulatory Compliance	Manual extract from Qualtrics Support. No MI visibility on acceptance.	Automated consent reporting & proactive alerts for non-responders.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Detailed Risk Analysis and Challenges
2.1. üîê User Access Management
Current Practice:

User access is manually managed.

Joiner-Mover-Leaver (JML) process is not integrated.

High dependency on email or ticket-based tracking.

Risks:

Users may retain access after leaving roles/org.

No real-time validation of entitlement.

Increased risk of unauthorized access or data misuse.

Recommendations:

Integrate HR JML feeds (via Workday/ServiceNow) for dynamic provisioning.

Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) tied to personas.

Maintain access logs with time stamps and role descriptions.

Quarterly access certification exercise.

Ownership:

People Tech or HRIS + Survey Tool Admin Team.

2.2. üìä Dashboard Access Management
Current Practice:

Access managed manually.

No expiration of temporary access.

No periodic review or ownership documentation.

Risks:

Risk of data leakage, especially for dashboards with sensitive demographics or feedback.

No clear data steward or dashboard owner.

Recommendations:

Introduce access request forms with approval workflows.

Set expiration date on access.

Automate review reminders every 3 months.

Maintain dashboard owner registry.

Metrics to Track:

Number of dashboards accessed per person.

% of expired/unused accesses.

Time taken to revoke access.

2.3. üìÅ Content Management & Export Tracking
Current Practice:

Survey data exports (e.g., Excel files) are not monitored.

Lack of audit logs on export frequency, purpose, or user.

Risks:

Potential uncontrolled data dissemination.

No audit trail for data protection impact assessments (DPIA).

Recommendations:

Request Qualtrics to enable logging of all export/download actions.

Maintain a central log of who exported what data, when, and why.

Notify owners if data is extracted from their dashboard.

KPIs:

Number of exports per user per month.

% of exports linked to active dashboard owners.

2.4. üõ°Ô∏è Data Privacy Consent Management
Current Practice:

Data privacy statement shown every 6 months.

Consent info only available via manual extract from Qualtrics support.

Risks:

No real-time reporting on compliance.

Potential breach of data processing obligations under GDPR/local laws.

Recommendations:

Automate the tracking of consent status in reporting layer.

Generate periodic reports to identify non-consenting users.

Escalate or restrict access based on non-consent.

Who Should Own:

Legal / Data Privacy Team + Survey Governance Lead.

Connect with PeopleTech / HRIS for JML data feed integration.

Identify dashboard owners and create dashboard registry.

Draft roles and responsibilities matrix for each control area.

Review Legal/Privacy guidelines on data processing and consent.

Build a control dashboard to monitor key KPIs (ideally in Qlik or Qualtrics).

7Ô∏è‚É£ Discussion Points for the Team
What are the critical control risks we must address in next 3 months?

How do we divide ownership: IT, HRIS, Qualtrics Admin, Legal?

What metrics will we use to evaluate control performance?

Can we phase the implementation: Phase 1 (Access), Phase 2 (Export Logs), Phase 3 (Consent)?



----------------

Updated Section ‚Äì User Access Management
üìå Current Process ‚Äì Manual but Structured Workflow
The existing User Access Management in Qualtrics follows a multi-step gated process:

Access Request Initiation:

The user submits a request for privileged access via the Request Portal.

The request includes business justification and required user type (Viewer, Editor, Admin, etc.).

Line Manager (LM) Approval:

LM validates the user's need and approves the request.

Application Owner Validation:

The request is routed to the Application Owner to:

Review the business justification.

Validate the appropriateness of the requested user type.

Approve or modify the access type.

Provisioning Execution:

Once approved, the Provisioning Team executes the access amendment in Qualtrics.

Joiner-Mover-Leaver (JML) Process (Manual Oversight):

A separate internal team monitors organizational movement (using HR data).

If a user moves or exits, a manual incident is raised to flag their access.

A recertification email is sent to the LM to validate if the access should be retained.

Based on LM‚Äôs response, access is revoked or retained manually.

üö® Current Gaps and Risks
Gap	Risk	Impact
JML Process is disconnected from provisioning	Leaver access may remain active	Compliance and audit exposure
Manual incident-based triggers for leaver handling	Delayed response in revocation	Data exposure during the lag window
No system-level integration between HR data and Qualtrics	Reactive process vs. proactive control	Operational inefficiency
Application owner dependency on LM judgment alone	Potential over-provisioning	Insider threat surface expands

üí° Proposed Control Enhancement (As Suggested by Qualtrics)
Goal: Introduce HR Data Integration to automate JML-based access provisioning and revocation.

Integration Setup:

Connect Qualtrics to the HRIS endpoint (e.g., Workday or SAP).

Use unique User IDs or GUIDs to align system identity.

Monitor status changes: Active ‚Üí Inactive, BU Change, Role Change.

Control Outcome:

Auto-revoke access on separation (lever event).

Auto-adjust access when a user moves roles or BUs (mover event).

Reduce reliance on incident-based tracking and manual email trails.

Feasibility:

Qualtrics confirms this integration is technically feasible.

Requires stakeholder alignment across HRIS, IT Security, Provisioning, and Qualtrics Admin.

Implementation involves cost, time, and prioritization of integration roadmap.

‚úÖ Updated Recommendations
Area	Recommendation	Rationale
JML Integration	Assess cost-benefit for integrating HR feed with Qualtrics	Long-term reduction in manual errors and audit issues
Access Expiry Policy	Introduce optional expiry date for privileged access	Enforces access recertification
LM Validation	Require mandatory LM access revalidation every quarter	Ensures sustained need
Audit Logging	Maintain audit trail of who approved what and when	Readiness for compliance review
Role Governance	Define clear role matrix: Viewer, Editor, Admin, Owner	Avoid privilege creep

üìà Revised KPIs & SLA Metrics for Control Performance
Control Objective	KPI	SLA Target	Owner
Timely access revocation post-leaver	% of leavers revoked within 24 hrs	100%	Provisioning
Incident-to-closure time (for unaligned access)	Avg. resolution time	< 48 hrs	IAM team
Periodic recertification coverage	% of privileged users reviewed	100% quarterly	Application Owner
HR data integration implementation	Completion milestone & go-live	Q4 (tentative)	HRIS + IT Security

üéØ Key Takeaway
The current model is structurally sound but lacks real-time adaptability. The control weakness lies in the delayed signal-to-action gap for access revocation. The proposed HR integration is a strategic uplift that can:

Significantly reduce access lag.

Strengthen audit posture.

Reduce manual overhead and downstream dependency on incident escalations.

Would you like the next section (Dashboard Access Management) to also follow this level of depth and contextual fit‚Äîespecially covering:

Scale of dashboard estate (18+ dashboards).

Variability of user access (viewers vs. editors vs. owners).

Reporting/report scheduling concerns.

Ownership and expiry-based access?

----------------------



Updated Section ‚Äì Dashboard Access Management
‚úÖ 1. Current Process Overview: Dashboard Access Management
We manage 18+ critical HR and non-HR dashboards in Qualtrics Employee Experience, including:

Annual & Biannual Engagement

Sentiment / Culture

Pulse / Manager-led

Journey Dashboards (Onboarding, Learning, Progressing, Exit)

HR Case Satisfaction

HR Experience

Product Feedback

Each dashboard has unique stakeholders:

Culture dashboards ‚Üí Culture Team

Learning dashboards ‚Üí Talent & L&D

HR case dashboards ‚Üí HR Services

Journey dashboards ‚Üí Colleague Experience (onboarding/progression)

Access provisioning is handled via a shared access request form used across Reporting teams‚Äînot customized for dashboard-level granularity.

üß≠ 2. Current Challenges in Access Provisioning
Challenge Area	Description
Lack of Structured Dashboard Naming	Requesters input ambiguous names (e.g., ‚Äúsatisfaction dashboard‚Äù) instead of the official name (e.g., ‚ÄúHR Case Satisfaction EX Dashboard‚Äù)
Incorrect Approver Selection	Due to shared request form, requesters frequently pick line managers or irrelevant stakeholders instead of designated business approvers
Shared Ownership Workflow	Form goes first to Reporting team, then to Colleague Listening team for provisioning. Adds delay and confusion
Insufficient Access Type Clarification	Request doesn‚Äôt specify whether access is for viewing, exporting, or editing
Manual Approver Validation	Team manually follows up with incorrect approvers, delaying the request cycle
No Auto-Revoke on Role or Org Change	When an employee moves roles or leaves the org, access isn‚Äôt revoked unless flagged manually
No Central Registry of Dashboard Owners	Makes it hard to verify approval authority or create access policies

‚ö†Ô∏è 3. Key Control Gaps and Risk Implications
Gap	Risk	Business Impact
Ambiguous Dashboard Names	Incomplete understanding of the requested access	Provisioning errors or delay
Unverified Approvers	Risk of unauthorized data access	Data privacy exposure
No Role/BU Mapping	Cannot define rules by BU or role due to dashboard uniqueness	No scalable access policy
Manual Access Revoke	Leavers and movers retain legacy access	Audit failure, data misuse risk
Shared workflow with Reporting	Confusion in ownership and SLA failure	Stakeholder dissatisfaction

üõ†Ô∏è 4. Recommendations for Control Uplift
üìå Access Request Process Overhaul:
Introduce a dedicated Dashboard Access Request Form:

Dropdown list of official dashboard names (mapped from central registry).

Define access level: Viewer / Exporter / Editor.

Mandatory selection of dashboard-specific approver (pre-mapped).

Auto-routing to correct team (Colleague Listening, not Reporting).

üìå Dashboard Registry and Role Mapping:
Maintain a central dashboard catalogue:

Dashboard Name, Owner, Description, Suggested Access Roles.

Approved Business Units or Teams eligible for access.

Approver Email ID or Group ID.

üìå Auto-Revoke Integration (Long-Term):
Similar to User Access, integrate HR data feed to:

Flag leavers or movers.

Match against current access list per dashboard.

Trigger access removal automatically (or via report & approval).

üìå Workflow Reassignment:
Reconfigure request routing:

Split Reporting team requests from Qualtrics Dashboard requests.

Qualtrics-specific provisioning handled solely by Colleague Listening team.

üìà 5. SLA Expectations and KPI Monitoring
Control Objective	KPI	SLA Target	Owner
Dashboard Access Grant (accurate, timely)	% fulfilled within 3 working days	95%	Colleague Listening
Approver Validation	% of correct approvers selected on first request	90%	Request Portal Admin
Access Accuracy	% of requests that did not require clarification	85%	Requester / Approver
Revocation Timeliness	Avg. days to revoke access post-leaver	< 2 days	IAM / Dashboard Admin
Registry Maintenance	% of dashboards with owner & access matrix	100%	Governance Lead

üß≠ 6. Discussion Points with Team
How do we structure a central dashboard registry with approvers and role definitions?

Should we build a custom dashboard access form or adapt the existing request platform?

Can we link Qualtrics access logs to our internal audit layer to flag unapproved access?

What temporary mitigation can be done until auto-revoke integration is feasible?

How do we prioritize dashboards for pilot rollout of improved access workflows?

‚úÖ Immediate Actions
Draft a dashboard registry spreadsheet (Name, Description, Owner, Eligible Roles, Approver).

Propose a customized form for dashboard access ‚Äì dropdowns for dashboard names and access type.

Assign approvers to each dashboard (to avoid incorrect routing).

Build a dashboard owner group to validate requests.

Discuss with IT/Reporting about workflow bifurcation.

Raise a feasibility query to Qualtrics support on role-based dashboard access revocation via API.

Unified Governance Structure:

Bringing together User Access Management, Dashboard Access Management, and Content Management.

Gap Analysis + Risk Mapping across all three layers.

Proposed Control Framework: Frequency of checks, owners, KPIs, auditability.

Additional Perspectives You May Have Missed:

Blind spots.

Opportunities to automate or track better.

Actionable Summary you can take to your team.

Let‚Äôs build the complete strategic picture.

üìò Title: Strengthening Control and Content Governance in Qualtrics EX Platform
üî∂ A. OVERVIEW: What We Are Trying to Solve
We are managing a complex Qualtrics EX environment with:

Enterprise-level licensing.

18+ HR and Non-HR dashboards.

Surveys running across the colleague lifecycle.

Current issues are no longer just about ‚Äúgranting access‚Äù‚Äîthey now relate to whether that access is appropriate, used, maintained, and necessary, and whether data exports, privilege use, and ownership are being transparently managed.

We want to transition from:

From	To
Manual, reactive control	Automated, proactive control
Access-focused governance	Usage-based governance
Fragmented workflows	Centralized, policy-driven model
Limited MI	Insight-rich operational dashboards

1Ô∏è‚É£ USER ACCESS MANAGEMENT
üìå Process (As-Is)
Access granted through formal workflow (portal ‚Üí LM ‚Üí App Owner ‚Üí Provisioning).

Leaver/Mover access managed via incident-based manual review and revalidation by LM.

No dynamic linkage to HR data or user lifecycle automation.

‚ö†Ô∏è Gaps
Gap	Risk	Impact
Manual revocation post-move/exit	Stale privileged access	Data protection audit failure
No RBAC based on persona	Over-provisioning	Insider misuse potential
No expiry or review mechanism	Cumulative privilege sprawl	Breach of minimum access principles

‚úÖ Controls & Metrics
Control	Frequency	Owner	KPI
Access recertification	Quarterly	App Owner	100% reviewed
Leaver access check	Weekly	IAM	100% revoked within 48h
HRIS integration	One-time + monitoring	Tech + HR	% automated
Role definition matrix	One-time, reviewed annually	Governance Lead	% coverage across user types

2Ô∏è‚É£ DASHBOARD ACCESS MANAGEMENT
üìå Process (As-Is)
Shared access form ‚Üí routed via Reporting team ‚Üí Colleague Listening team.

Users request access without defined dashboard dropdown or approver mapping.

Approval routing is often inaccurate due to form limitations.

No revocation logic for movers/leavers.

No dashboard registry, owner, or usage mapping.

‚ö†Ô∏è Gaps
Gap	Risk	Impact
No dropdown or ID-based selection	Incorrect provisioning	Wasted effort, wrong access
Inaccurate approvers	Unauthorised approvals	Non-compliant dashboard exposure
No linkage to roles/BUs	Can't apply dynamic revocation	Compliance risk on separation
Shared workflow creates confusion	SLA miss	Stakeholder dissatisfaction

‚úÖ Controls & Metrics
Control	Frequency	Owner	KPI
Dashboard registry with owners & approvers	One-time, reviewed quarterly	Survey Governance	100% dashboards registered
Access logging and expiry tracking	Monthly	Provisioning Team	% expired accesses removed
Custom form with dropdown dashboard list	Implementation	Tech / Reporting	% of requests correctly routed
Revoke dashboard access post-move	Weekly (if HR data available)	IAM	% revoked within SLA

3Ô∏è‚É£ CONTENT MANAGEMENT (NEW SECTION)
Content Management is about what is being done with the access given‚Äîi.e., access doesn‚Äôt end at permission, but rather extends into usage, auditability, insight, and actionability.

üéØ Content Dimensions We Need to Track
Metric	Description	Risk if Missing
Access Logs	Who viewed what dashboard, how often, when	No usage visibility, no audit
Multi-Dashboard Users	Users holding access to multiple unrelated dashboards (e.g., Learning + Exit)	Misaligned access, risk of cross-functional exposure
Inactive Users	Users who never accessed after provision	Wasted access, over-allocation
Export Frequency	Who is exporting Excel data, how many times per dashboard	Data leakage / misuse
Survey Creators vs. Survey Runners	Users who requested survey creator roles but never used them	Privilege without purpose
Survey Lifecycle Use	No. of surveys created, responses received, closure timelines	Stale or unused surveys cluttering system
Overlapping Privileges	Users with Create + Distribute + Analyze for unrelated surveys	Excessive power, weak segmentation

‚ö†Ô∏è Gaps in Content Governance
Gap	Risk	Control Opportunity
No analytics on usage or exports	Data misuse goes undetected	Integrate Qualtrics usage analytics
No owner to monitor usage	Ownership vacuum	Assign Content Governance Analyst or Owner
Privilege granted but underused	Access may not be needed	Implement access reviews tied to usage
No survey archival policy	Tool cluttered with stale data	Add deactivation policy for surveys after X months of inactivity

‚úÖ Controls & Metrics for Content Management
Control	Metric	Frequency	Owner
Dashboard Usage Analytics	Views/user/month, time spent	Monthly	Admin + Data Ops
Excel Export Audit Logs	Exports/user/month	Monthly	Governance Lead
Survey Creation vs. Usage	# created vs. # launched	Quarterly	Qualtrics Admin
Access Review (based on usage)	Inactive user %	Quarterly	Provisioning
Content Cleanup (Survey archiving)	Surveys untouched > 6 months	Quarterly	Data Hygiene Analyst
Multi-Dashboard Mapping	# users with 3+ dashboard accesses	Monthly	Access Governance

üîé 4Ô∏è‚É£ ADDITIONAL GOVERNANCE PERSPECTIVES YOU MAY HAVE MISSED
Perspective	What to Consider
Behavioral Analytics	Use Qualtrics logs to analyze behavior like heavy downloaders or infrequent viewers
Segregation of Duties (SoD)	Ensure the same user isn‚Äôt designing, launching, analyzing, and exporting sensitive surveys
Tool Rationalization	Are any dashboards or surveys redundant or duplicative? Should some be sunset?
Auto-Provisioning via Business Logic	Instead of manual access, use rules like: ‚ÄúL&D staff auto-get Learning Dashboard access‚Äù
Integration with SIEM or DLP tools	Export logs should be fed into Data Loss Prevention tools if high-risk data is being downloaded

üö¶ 5Ô∏è‚É£ UNIFIED GAP & CONTROL CHECKLIST (SUMMARY VIEW)
Domain	Gap	Risk	Control Recommendation	Metric
User Access	No automated revocation	Orphaned access	JML + HR integration	Revocation SLA
Dashboard Access	No clear owner/approver mapping	Incorrect access	Dashboard registry	Accuracy rate
Dashboard Access	No naming standard	Confusion, misrouting	Dropdown naming convention	% correctly routed
Content	No usage data	No accountability	Dashboard usage analytics	Views/export logs
Content	Privilege unused	Over-provisioning	Usage-based recertification	% unused access
Content	Survey never launched	Waste of provisioning	Launch-based creator review	Creator vs. launcher ratio

‚úÖ 6Ô∏è‚É£ NEXT STEPS (FOR TEAM DISCUSSION)
Assign owners for each control area (Access, Dashboard, Content).

Build dashboard registry with official names, owners, approvers, eligible roles.

Discuss tool changes needed for:

Custom access form

HR data integration for JML

Access analytics & export logs

Schedule governance reviews every quarter to evaluate control health.

Raise feasibility with Qualtrics on export tracking, usage analytics, auto revocation triggers.

Propose policy for survey retention, archival, and sunset.
