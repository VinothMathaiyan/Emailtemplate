Subject: Update on Survey Automation and Remediation for Missed Learnings

Dear [Stakeholder's Name],

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to provide you with an update regarding the recent request to adjust the survey automation for learning feedback.

As a remediation for the missed learnings due to the 7-day logic, we will proceed with a manual run to capture those missed entries. However, Iâ€™d like to clarify a few points:

The file we received from the data team includes learning data from the last 6 months, excluding any learning already executed.
To avoid overwhelming the system and hitting the API limit of 500 records per second, I recommend that we do not run all the learning from this file in one go. Instead, we will focus on the missed learnings that fall under the new 14-day window.
While updating the logic to 14 days will help minimize the issue moving forward, there is still a risk of encountering API call failures. To mitigate this, I suggest increasing the frequency of the file updates to better manage the data and reduce the volume of records in each run.
Please let me know if you agree with this approach or if you'd like to discuss any adjustments.
