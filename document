Survey Update Process: High-Level Overview
This document outlines the key steps involved in updating our survey system, ensuring smooth data integration and a positive user experience.

1. Data Source and Preparation

Identify Data Source: We'll first determine how participant data is currently delivered (flat file or directly from Employee Directory).
Flat File Processing (if applicable):
Download data from Workday.
Mandatory Step: Modify column headers to align with the Employee Directory format. This prevents unnecessary column creation in the Expected Data (ED) format.
Employee Directory Automation (if applicable):
Review the existing fields and data values.
Update the participant import automation to reflect these changes.
2. Survey Design and User Experience

Survey Duplication and Modification:
Create a duplicate of the current survey for modifications.
Update embedded data and associated logic within the survey.
User Experience (UX) Optimization:
Implement all current design principles for banners, themes, accessibility, and Barclays logo usage.
Email Invites: Design email invites with consistent visual elements (banner, logo) and adhere to UX design principles.
3. Dashboard Updates

Data Mapping and Filter Adjustments:
Update filters and widgets to reflect the introduction of new data fields.
Ensure accurate data mapping within the dashboards.
Dashboard Role Access Review:
If metadata is used for role-based access within the dashboards, update it accordingly.
4. Automation Updates

Workflow Transition:
As Qualtrics now prioritizes workflows over import automation, we will update all our projects to utilize workflows for participant data import.
